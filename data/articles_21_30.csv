https://www.thejournal.ie/list-of-problems-that-could-affect-ireland-for-brexit-negotiations-4840629-Oct2019/,"A LIST OF potential issues for Ireland post-Brexit allegedly drawn up by Michael Gove’s Brexit operations committee could be used in a ‘malicious’ way to exert pressure on the Irish government, according to Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokesperson.
Gove’s Brexit operations committee has allegedly made a list of potential issues that could affect the Republic of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, The Times UK newspaper reported earlier today.
Problem areas raised by ministers that could be used as leverage if negotiations break down include that:
There is also the potential to lose fishing rights off the coast of Northern Ireland.
The Times also reported that ministers are considering some “sweeteners” to offer the Republic such as funding aid for infrastructure needed to enforce custom checks at the border.

Fianna Fáil Brexit spokesperson Lisa Chambers spoke to RTÉ’sNews at Onetoday about this alleged list of issues.
Chambers said that although it was a good thing in certain respects for the UK to list out the impacts for Ireland, there are fears it could be used as leverage “ in a malicious way to try and undermine the negotiation and try and exert pressure on the Irish government”.
“I think it’s a good thing that the UK have acknowledged that their Brexit policy has significant negative impacts for Ireland and our citizens, and I think it’s right and proper that they would consider those,” she said.
“What’s not okay is the suggestion that they might use that to put pressure on the Irish government to somehow move in a particular direction for Brexit.
“If that is the MO the government are pursuing now in the UK, that is worrying because that sets a particular tone and removes an element of goodwill and trust between the UK and Ireland.”
Chambers said that she has “no doubt” some MPs and cabinet members see Ireland as “the problem and possibly the enemy” in reaching a Brexit deal with the European Union.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-newspapers-front-pages-daily-mail-4856302-Oct2019/,"AS THE UK, Ireland and the rest of the EU reacts to Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, British newspapers have been giving their reaction to the plan, which the prime minister will now try to get through the House of Commons.
The Times says the “final hurdle” is “in sight”, and reports that Mr Johnson will spend the next 24 hours “frantically trying to sell it to MPs”.

The Daily Telegraphsays Johnson will give Parliament an ultimatum saying it is his deal or no deal.

The Guardianreports the deal will be subject to a “knife-edge vote” and reports it will be a numbers game in the Commons after the DUP said it would not support the government.

The Financial Times refers to Mr Johnson’s moves on Brexit as a “gamble”.

The i reports the “tricky part” is still to come with the looming Commons vote on Saturday, and the Independent says rebels “hold the key to a final say” on the proposals.

The Daily Mirror suggests we are in a similar territory to before, saying the country is “on the brink of Brexit… once again”.

Both The Sun and the Daily Mail lead with messages to “dithering” MPs to get behind the deal Mr Johnson has struck.


In Northern Ireland, on which Brexit negotiations have focused, the DUP reaction to the deal dominates.
The Belfast Telegraph quotes the DUP prominently on its front page – “There is no perfect deal but let’s work on it.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/britains-unwritten-constitution-discussed-in-history-4823246-Sep2019/,"THE UNITED KINGDOM is in the throes of a constitutional crisis that has raised old concerns about its constitutional arrangements and new fears about the integrity of its democracy.
A constitution normally takes the form of a single document, which, among other things, spells out the location of sovereignty and describes the different institutions of the state – the parliament, government, courts, president and so on.
It delineates the nature and limits of each institution’s powers and roles, and the scope of legitimate action and hierarchy among them. This is not the case for the United Kingdom.
Its constitution is secreted in parliamentary laws, resolutions, often old legal decisions and layers of customary practice and gentlemen’s agreements.
This is why Prime Minister Johnson’s actions to suspend parliament were ruledunlawful, not unconstitutional.
Brexit has brought unprecedented confusion and conflict in the UK about the sovereign pecking order of its state institutions.
For example, the established principle of parliamentary sovereignty has been thrown into question by the popular sovereignty expressed in a rarely used referendum mechanism.
The obscure power of the monarch to prorogue (or suspend) parliament, usually seen as entirely ceremonial, now reappears as a reminder of older feudal conflicts between the crown and parliament.
While retention of the practice of the prime minister requesting the monarch to suspend parliament underlines the perils of building a democracy on gentlemen’s agreements and presumption of their good faith.
Another crisis
Over 100 years ago, during an earlier British constitutional crisis, Irishman Tom Kettle satirised England’s attachment to its unwritten constitution and the “regular musketry-rattle” of hear-hears that followed its mention in the parliament.
While still in his 20s, Kettle was one of the last young Irish Party MPs committed to advancing the nationalist cause through parliamentary means and an outspoken champion of the rights of women and labour.
In 1909, the House of Lords rejected the government’s redistributive people’s budget.
The ensuing stand-off between the two houses of parliament triggered a crisis that eventually led to the curtailment of the House of Lords’ veto. Like Brexit, the Irish Question was at the centre of unfolding events.

As Chris Dooley recounts in his biography of John Redmond, the budget debacle created conditions for a renewed overlap of interests between the Liberals and the Irish Party whereby the latter supported the budget in exchange for a clipping of the Lords’ veto – the perennial obstacle to Home Rule.
In response to the British constitutional crisis of the day, Kettle wrote an essay on written constitutions published in 1910.
He characterises the prevailing “prejudice” against written constitutions as “beyond doubt, one of the best-established superstitions of English politics”.
He calls Dicey’s Law of the Constitution, a highly influential law text published in 1885 and still used today, “that masterpiece of romance”.
He discusses the notion encouraged by Dicey that continental jurists, disappointed by their own “miserable paper guarantees of freedom”, are jealous of Britain’s unwritten constitution.
Kettle says they instead say the British constitution would “without doubt be admirable, but, Alas! it does not exist”.
He adds that this is ” by no means respectfully” and that the reverence for the unwritten constitution is “stately nonsense” and that there is nothing “peculiarly English in this dread of documents”.
Kettle explains that “in dealing with England, you are not dealing with an unwritten constitution, but with a badly written constitution”.
He adds that before the print age, in its 1910 heydey, relying on documents would have been rare.
“To rely on custom rather than on documents is antiquarian pedantry,” he wrote in 1910.
The true aim of conservatives who “sing the praises of tacit agreements, accepted conventions and other elements of unwritten constitutions”, Kettle argues, is to limit democracy by “keeping government separated from the dust, the tumult, and the heartiness of common life”.
But liberals, who Kettle said joined in mythologizing the unwritten constitution, engaged in “high treason against those two born progressives, the pen and the printing press”.
Instead, they should be saying of Britain’s constitution, “since so much has been written, let us write the rest, and write it clearly”.
Ultimately, Kettle’s essay is a passionate defence of the role of the written word and the critical press in democracy and a call on Britain to make “a constitution for herself” as a prelude to “us all … making a Constitution for Ireland”.
The unfolding crisis in the UK makes Kettle’s advice to Britain in 1910 strikingly relevant over a century later.

Yesterday, British Prime Minister candidate Boris Johnson said that he does“not believe for a moment”that the UK will leave without a deal, but said he would be willing to do so if he got the top job.

https://www.thejournal.ie/conservative-ministers-resign-brexit-4843539-Oct2019/,"A NUMBER OF ministers in Boris Johnson’s Cabinet are reportedly ready to resign over concerns he is leading the UK towards a no-deal Brexit.
Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith, Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, Health Minister Matt Hancock and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox are all on a “resignation watch list”, according toa report in The Times.
An unnamed minister is quoted in the newspaper as saying a “very large number” of Conservative MPs will quit if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal.
Ministers have reportedly raised concerns about Johnson’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings, as well as the “grave” risk of the return of direct rule in Northern Ireland.
“Cabinet will set the strategy, not unelected officials. If this is an attempt to do that then it will fail. We are not a cabinet of sock puppets and nodding dogs,” the report quotes another minister as saying.
Johnson and Leo Varadkar spoke about Brexit over the phone yesterday evening. After the  conversation, a spokesperson for the Irish government said: “Both sides strongly reiterated their desire to reach a Brexit deal. They hope to meet in person later this week.”
Speaking onRTÉ News last night, the Taoiseach said he believed it would be “very difficult” to secure a deal ahead of a crucial European Council summit next week.
“Essentially what the United Kingdom has done is repudiated the deal that we negotiated in good faith with Prime Minister May’s government over two years.
“And they’ve sort of put half of that back on the table and saying that’s a concession, and of course it isn’t really,” Varadkar said.

‘Stupid blame game’
Downing Street sources yesterday claimed that German chancellor Angela Merkel had made clear that an agreement was now “overwhelmingly unlikely”.
Following a telephone call with Johnson, she was said to have insisted Ireland must have a veto over Northern Ireland leaving the customs union.
The claims provoked a furious response from European Council president Donald Tusk who accused Johnson of jeopardising the future security of the EU and the UK.
“Boris Johnson, what’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,” he tweeted.
“At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don’t want a deal, you don’t want an extension, you don’t want to revoke, quo vadis?”

Johnson’s official spokesman confirmed there had been a “frank exchange” of views with Merkel, but refused to be drawn any further.
Meanwhile, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the UK government must be willing to work with the EU in order to finalise a Brexit deal. Coveney said it was “hard to disagree” with the sentiment of Tusk’s comments.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-alternative-4833794-Oct2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has published his alternative to the backstop, which would mean custom checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and regulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Calling the backstop “a bridge to nowhere”, Johnson states that Northern Ireland will leave the EU’s Custom Union with the rest of the UK, but that customs checks do not need to take place “at, or even near, that border”.
In a letter to the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Johnson said that the Withdrawal Agreement has been rejected by the UK parliament three times, and that this current proposal would “remove” the backstop from that Brexit deal.
In short,the proposals suggestregulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and custom checks on goods going between Ireland and Northern Ireland:
In his letter to Juncker, Johnson says that the Northern Ireland Executive should vote on the proposals during the transition period, before the new rules come into play; and that a vote on the arrangements should be held every four years afterwards.
If the Northern Ireland Executive vote against these proposals, the document says that “the arrangements will not enter into force or will lapse (as the case may be) after one year, and arrangements will default to existing rules”.
As has been pointed out byBritish journalists, it’s not clear what existing rules these are, and the UK government hasn’t yet clarified.
Emphasising the UK’s intention to leave the Customs Union, Johnson says that this is “entirely compatible” with maintaining an open border, but also acknowledged that the proposals would mean changes from the current border situation.
Advertisement
The explanatory note in which these details are contained say that the UK government is “absolutely committed to upholding the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement… [and] will not, under any circumstances, impose a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.”
Foragri-foods, the proposals say that Northern Ireland would “align with EU SPS rules, including those relating to the placing on the market of agri-food goods”. Agrifoods sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland would go through a Border Inspection Post or Designated Point of Entry as required by EU law, and be subjected to identity and documentary checks and physical examination by UK authorities.
Formanufactured goods, Northern Ireland would also follow the relevant EU rules, with those rules reinforced by “ensuring that regulatory checks can be implemented at the boundary of the zone”.
The documents state that as a result: “the regulatory checks and controls taking place on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would not apply when goods enter Ireland from Northern Ireland. The UK would not apply corresponding checks or controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from Ireland”.
Johnson also proposed changes to the Political Declaration on the Future Relationship, which allows for a “level-playing field” between the two nations.
Reaction
EC PresidentJean-Claude Junckergave a statement following a phone call with Boris Johnson this evening, in which he acknowledged “the positive advances, notably with regards to the full regulatory alignment for all goods and the control of goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain”.
The statementreiterated the point that the EU wants a deal, and meetings between the EU and the UK will take place in Brussels over the next few days.
Reacting to the proposals,the DUPsaid that they were “entirely consistent with the spirit and principles of the Belfast Agreement, demonstrate commitment to working with our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland in a spirit of mutual co-operation whilst respecting the integrity of Northern Ireland’s economic and constitutional position within the United Kingdom”.

A total of £1.1 billion is being provided to departments and devolved administrations to spend immediately with a further £1 billion held in reserve.
“With 92 days until the UK leaves the European Union it’s vital that we intensify our planning to ensure we are ready,” Javid said in a statement.
“We want to get a good deal that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. But if we can’t get a good deal, we’ll have to leave without one. This additional £2.1 billion will ensure we are ready to leave on 31 October – deal or no deal.”
The extra funding will be used for border and customs operations, medical supplies, support for Britons living abroad as well as a nationwide an awareness campaign.

The Treasury has now allocated £6.3bn to prepare for a no-deal Brexit – including £4.2bn of funding for this financial year.

On Sunday, Conservative MP Michael Gove said the British government is “operating on the assumption” that Britain will leave the EU without a deal on 31 October.
Meanwhile, voting in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election takes place today.
Former Conservative MP Chris Davies was unseated following a recall petition after he pleaded guilty to Parliamentary expenses fraud. Despite his conviction, the Conservatives have re-selected him as the party’s candidate in the key by-election.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-house-of-commons-4824954-Sep2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has challenged the opposition to call a no-confidence vote in his premiership in a bullish speech in which he again said the Supreme Court “was wrong” to rule against his government.
Johnson was speaking in the House of Commons this evening a day after theUK Supreme Court found that he acted unlawfullyin attempting to shut down parliament for five weeks.
Speaking amid roars from opposition MPs in a raucous debate, Johnson repeatedly accused the opposition of seeking to stop Brexit against the wishes of the British public.
“They are going to cancel the first referendum, they are going to legislate for a second referendum and this time they will promise that they will respect that vote and they think that people will vote to remain and everybody will forget about the last few years. I think Mr Speaker that is a great delusion and fantasy,” Johnson said.
The Prime Minister repeatedly criticised Labour MPs for voting against or abstaining in thevote to hold a general election.
He added: “It is not just to say that this parliament is gridlocked, paralysed and refusing to deliver on the priorities of the people. It’s not just unable to move forward, it’s worse than that Mr Speaker, out of sheer political cowardice members opposite are unwilling to move aside and give the people a say.”

“The Supreme Court was asked to intervene in the process for the first time ever and it is absolutely no disrespect to the judiciary to say that I think that the court was wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at what is a time of great national controversy,” Johnson said.

To shouts from his colleagues towards Johnson of “resign, resign”, Corbyn added:
“After yesterday’s ruling Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister should have done the honourable thing and resigned. Yet Mr Speaker he was forced back to this house to face the scrutiny he tried to avoid.”
Corbyn also said he would support the holding of a general election once the Brexit date of 31 October is extended.
Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said that Johnson owed the country and the UK’s Queen an apology.
“The Prime Minister needs to understand that actions have consequences. Even my five-year-old knows that when you do something wrong you have to say sorry,” she said.
Johnson ignored Swinson’s request that he apologise and went on the attack, saying she owed the country an apology for “writing to the President of the European Commission, asking him not to do a deal with this country”.

The Party has revealed that it has vetted 635 people for its approved candidate list for election, which is 15 candidates short of ensuring the party can fight every seat.
“We managed to turn all that anger that was out there in this country into optimism and hope,” he said at an event today called ‘We Are Ready’, in preparation for a general election that Farage himself said he expected in the autumn.
“The British people have made up their minds and we will not be changing it.”
The Brexit Party was formed in January 2019, in the wake of Nigel Farage leaving his former party Ukip after it became “too extreme”. In the UK’sEuropean elections, the Brexit Party won a 31.7% share of the vote, andfailed to winits first seat in a recent bye-election in Peterborough.
The Brexit Party is seen to be competing for the Tory party’s voters as it becomes increasingly fractured over Brexit-related issues. The Brexit Party’s views are more extreme, favouring a no-deal Brexit above all-else.
“A clean break Brexit on 31 October is by far the most popular option in this country,” Farage said today. “No deal is the best deal, it’s the only acceptable deal.”

He called Theresa May “the worst and most duplicitous Prime Minister in British history”, said that he’s “pleased that Boris Johnson has brought some energy and optimism to that job”, and welcomed Johnson’s pledges to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October “do or die”.
He said that May “impressed me I have to say at her Lancaster House speech. She said that they would leave by 29 March” which then turned into an extension until 31 October. Farage then he asked “Can you trust Boris Johnson on this issue?”

Farage decried the £39 billion Brexit divorce bill, and that the Withdrawal Agreement would leave the UK under the jurisdiction of the European Courts of Justice for the next eight years.
“We would not be able to make changes to state aid rules”, Farage continued, using British Steel as an example. The company went into liquidation in May this year after talks with the government collapsed – around 3,000 jobs are at risk.
“With this Withdrawal Agreement we would be unable to stand up for British Steel and that makes it unacceptable,” Farage said, while also blaming the “impotent government”.
In a statement that drew a rousing round of applause and a standing ovation from the assembled crowd, Farage said:
Farage also said that he suspected that efforts of opposition parties to stop a no-deal Brexit in parliament “would fail”, namingeach of the partiesengaged in talks with Jeremy Corbyn and prompting booes from the audience on each.

BORIS JOHNSON HAS TOLD Angela Merkel in Berlin that the Irish backstop must be removed if a Brexit deal is to be struck.
Speaking in Berlin this afternoon, Johnson said:
“We do need the backstop removed. If we can do that I am absolutely certain we can move forward together.”
He said the UK cannot accept the Withdrawal Agreement in its current form, stating that it “divides the UK”.
“We want a deal, we seek a deal. I believe we can get one, we can do it,” said Johnson.
Specifically on the backstop, Johnson said there are “grave, grave defects” with it, stating that “plainly, it has to go”.
Irish backstop
“Once we get rid of it, there is chance to make real progress,” he added, stating that he is “not attracted to a time limit” on the backstop either.
He repeated during the press conference that once the backstop is removed, alternative arrangements can be found.
Merkel suggested today that a solution to the Brexit stalemate could be found if new proposals to protect the Single Market were put forward “in the next 30 days”.
“If one is able to solve this conundrum, if one finds this solution, we said we would probably find it in the next two years to come but we can also maybe find it in the next 30 days to come,” she said.
Merkel added:
Johnson said there are an “abundance” of arrangements that could solve the problem, admitting that the British government has not been “actively proposing” alternatives.
On the border issue, the UK prime minister reiterated that the UK “will under no circumstances” impose checks of any kind along the Northern Ireland border.
He said “the onus is on us to produce those ideas, those solutions to the Northern Ireland border”.

Merkel said the backstop has always been “a fallback” in the agreement, stating that it is an “expression of a problem that we have not yet seen”.
“Britain should tell us what sort of ideas it has,” she said to Johnson in relation to the alternative arrangements it is proposing, with the UK prime minster stating that the “blistering” 30 day time limit to produce solutions is something he could accept.
Merkel added that she has learned a lot about the Good Friday Agreement, and the ramifications to Northern Ireland if it is not honoured.
“We think there are ways to protect the EU Singer Market…  that is clearly what we need to work on to secure,” said Johnson.
He added that he believes there are “borderless arrangements” that can be achieved mentioning trader scheme arrangements, as well as electronic pre-clearance systems.
Merkel said if the UK wishes to leave the EU it must respect the Good Friday Agreement. She said there are two positions, and at first glance, it might seem difficult to align the two, but a solution must be reached.
This is the first visit in the UK prime minister’s marathon of tense talks with key European and international leaders as the threat of a no-deal Brexit looms.
On Thursday, he will attempt to do the same with French President Emmanuel Macron.
At the weekend all three will meet US President Donald Trump, a vocal supporter of Brexit, alongside the leaders of Canada, Italy and Japan at a G7 summit in the French seaside resort of Biarritz.

Just hours before the German Chancellor was to welcome Johnson to Berlin, she warned of the economic impact a chaotic no-deal Brexit could bring .
“The economic sky is not cloudless”, and global tensions and Britain’s impending departure from the European Union “are already causing us headaches”, Merkel told an aviation industry conference.
“That’s why I will talk with the British prime minister, who is visiting me today, about how we can avoid friction as much as possible as Britain exits the EU because we have to struggle to achieve economic growth,” the leader of the bloc’s biggest economy added.
Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert stressed that an orderly Brexit would be “in every respect preferable” to a disorderly withdrawal of Britain, but that Germany was also preparing for the worst-case scenario.
In Berlin today, Johnson was received with military honours before his talks with Merkel.
Although chances for a breakthrough appeared slim, a Merkel spokesman said that, after the two had spoken by phone, “sitting at a table together to discuss Brexit and other European issues … is of course useful”.
Yesterday EU Council PresidentDonald Tusk saidthat the EU would not cave in to Johnson’s demand to scrap the so-called Irish border backstop plan, while Tánaiste Simon Coveney “conveyed disappointment” withBoris Johnson’s letterto the EU during a phone call with UK Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay.

Ireland
Tánaiste Simon Coveney will also to travel to five European capital cities in the next week to copper-fasten Brexit support for Ireland.
Coveney expressed concern at the lack of alternatives to the backstop in the letter and repeated the need for legal certainty on the border issue.
As Brexit deadline approaches, and with neither side appearing to compromise on their positions, the Tánaiste has decided to do a whistle-stop tour of Europe in a bid to firm up support for Ireland’s position on Brexit, and in particular the backstop.
While a government source said support is strong from European leaders, the Tánaiste is travelling to the capitals to ensure support does not slip.
Coveney will kick off a series of visits over the next week, beginning in Copenhagen.
The purpose of the visits is to discuss Brexit and the EU’s other priorities, but the main focus will be on ensuring there is no wavering of support on the Irish backstop as the 31 October Brexit deadline approaches.
The Tánaiste will travel to Denmark today, staying until Thursday and will be the first EU foreign minister to visit since elections there in June.
The Tánaiste will meet with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod.
It is understood the Irish government will use the opportunity to thank the people of Denmark and the new government for their continued support on Brexit and the Withdrawal Agreement.
The Tánaiste will address Denmark’s ambassadors from around the world at their heads of mission conference, and he will also launch a media offensive by taking part in a number of TV and print interviews.
Next week the Tánaiste will continue his European visit, travelling to Prague in the Czech Republic on Tuesday, Paris on Wednesday and Helsinki, Finland on Thursday and Friday. Next Sunday, Coveney will visit Warsaw in Poland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-medicine-stockpiling-4823345-Sep2019/,"STOCKPILES OF MEDICINES to last until the New Year are in place in case of a “worst case scenario” no-deal Brexit, according to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).
The Oireachtas Health Committee will today be told that since the beginning of this year the HPRA’s preparations for Brexit and engagement with stakeholders have intensified.
It will also be told no major supply concerns have been identified to date.
“A key part of their Brexit planning is to ensure that there is sufficient stock in Ireland so that temporary delays during transportation will not significantly affect access by patients to medicines,” Lorraine Nolan, Chief Executive of the HPRA will state in her opening statement.
The HPRA will tell the committee today that all primary wholesalers have provided assurances that for the vast majority of medicines eight to ten weeks of stock will be held.
“This level of stock holding will allow Ireland manage short-term disruptions to the supply of medicines. We have also, as part of our engagement with companies supplying the market, requested them to confirm that they will have sufficient stock levels (8 to 10 weeks) at 31 October and can maintain these levels post-Brexit period by appropriate replenishment procedures,” committee members will hear.
Medicine shortages unlikely
“Ireland is unlikely to face general medicine shortages in the period immediatelyafter the 31st October. Any emerging supply issues will, in the first instance, bedealt with from existing supplies held within the domestic distribution chain. Thissupply chain is different to that of some other markets, including the UK,” Nolan will say.
In relation to the supply of medicines post-Brexit, the HPRA states that it needs to be recognised that some products will still either come from the UK by air or sea or by necessity be transported across the UK.
While assurances from suppliers have been made, the HPRA will state that “significant and prolonged delays anywhere along these routes could potentially interruptsupply to the Irish market”.
“While our preparations are focused on ensuring that such impacts are prevented or minimised, there are no absolute guarantees,” Nolan will state.
The HPRA will reiterate that its shortages protocol framework, which predates Brexit (as medicines shortages can occur for various reasons on an ongoing basis) is in place.
“The health system is, therefore, well placed to deal with any additional shortages as a consequence of Brexit, should they occur,” the committee will hear.
For medicines where stock levels are less eight to ten weeks, the HPRA is “actively working” with the wholesale sector on addressing potential Brexit impacts to ensure “that cases where continuity of patient care could be compromised are in so far as possible addressed”.
“This includes the ability if possible to build additional stock levels and the development of contingency arrangements to ensure a sustained process of stock replenishment. The work remains ongoing,” Nolan will tell politicians.
In terms of the supply of critical medicines, which have a short shelf-life, have refrigerated supply chains, and have time-critical logistics, the HPRA is working with the HSE to review supply arrangements for all prescription medicines.
The review involves liaising directly with hospitals, companies and distributors to identify supply routes and ensure companies have contingency plans in place if their supply routes come from or through the UK.
Critical medicines
Giving practical examples of radiopharmaceuticals and insulin, Nolan said some medicines do make their way to Ireland via the UK.

Some radiopharmaceuticals, which have a short shelf-life and need a specialised transport and storage arrangements are flown from continental Europe to Ireland via East Midlands airport by one logistics company.
Nolan will tell members today that companies who use this route have previously received assurances from their logistics provider that it will continue to operate these supply routes post-Brexit as it does currently.
“We have been in contact with the companies who supply these products to the Irish market who have confirmed their intention and plans to continue the supply to Ireland post Brexit. We have also requested written assurances from the logistics provider involved. Separately there is ongoing direct engagement with the logistics provider in question to ensure that their service can be relied upon and if necessary consider alternative solutions that may be required.
“Currently all the responses we have received indicate that all parties believe that they can continue to supply the Irish market and all parties are actively considering contingency plans,” Nolan will state.
In terms of insulins, which are critical medicines for diabetic patients, the HPRA has engaged with the three suppliers of insulins to Ireland who have all provided assurances that they will have a minimum of eight to ten weeks stock of all insulins in Irish wholesalers on 31 October.
In addition, all suppliers have taken steps to ensure that they are in a position to replenish these stocks post-Brexit, including the use of alternative transport routes which do not involve supply from or via the UK, the committee will be told.
Do not stockpile
The HPRA will again repeat its warning to hospitals, pharmacists and patients that there is no need for them to stockpile medicines.
Due to the already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicine supply chain and due to there being a different wholesaling model than the UK not stockpiling is needed.
Stockpiling extra quantities of medicines could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients, the committee will be told.
“Patients should continue to fill their prescriptions as normal,” the HPRA chief executive will state.
In his opening statement to the committee today, Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health will state that he is “satisfied that the health sector is working well to prepare for Brexit.
He will tell members that the department has engaged extensively with suppliers both in their industry and on an individual company basis in respect of products, stressing to them the importance of providing early information on any emerging issues.
“We have assured them that we are in problem solving mode. We are focused on pre-empting or solving problems using pragmatic solutions and we will be there to trouble shoot with industry issues that arise in the days and weeks following Brexit,” Breslin will state.
Health spending going to Brexit planning
The committee will hear that this year, the government has committed over €10 million in funding to health sector Brexit preparations.
While the health budget is in a precarious position just two weeks out from the Budget, Breslin will tell the committee today that if Brexit proceeds on a no-deal basis on the 31st October next, “it will be necessary to incur further costs this year and on an ongoing basis”.
He will also state that such funds could have been used for other health projects.
“We could do much to improve our health services with this money but instead we must use these resources to mitigate any potential Brexit impact on population health.
“Neither is Brexit a temporary or once-off adverse event – it represents permanentchange in many aspects of daily life encompassing how we trade, import andregulate goods and services including health-related products,” Breslin will state.

https://www.thejournal.ie/kbc-consumer-sentiment-brexit-4837151-Oct2019/,"CONSUMER SENTIMENT HAS dropped to its lowest level in almost six years ahead of the looming Brexit deadline of 31 October.
The KBC Consumer Sentiment Index has fallen to 75.3% in September from 77.2% in August.
While the drop in confidence in September was notably smaller than in either of the two months previous, it was still sufficient to push the sentiment reading to its lowest level in nearly six years.
The last time the Index was lower than at present was in November 2013 when it stood at 71%.
The decline in Irish consumer sentiment in September stands in contrast to modest monthly improvements in similar confidence indicators elsewhere, according to KBC’s chief economist Austin Hughes.
In the US, consumer sentiment partly reversed a significant drop seen in the August reading.
For the Euro area as a whole, the rise in consumer confidence in September marginally exceeded the drop recorded in August.
Even in the UK, consumer confidence edged higher in September, led by in perceptions of household finances.

KBCKBC
The contrast between September 2019 sentiment readings for Ireland and elsewhere seems to reflect two related factors, according to Hughes.
Firstly, in terms of the factors influencing confidence among Irish consumers at present, it seems that Brexit concerns are not the main issue, they are the only issue, he said.
Secondly, he said unlike their counterparts in other countries where the mood of consumers is being buffeted by uncertainty, Irish consumers appear now to be almost exclusively on downside risks.
Four of the five main components of the KBC Irish consumer sentiment were lower in September than in August.
The only element to improve was consumers’ assessment of the buying climate which rose marginally.
“Whether Irish consumer sentiment has now reached peak Brexit gloom depends how still volatile political conditions in the UK develop and how related decisions translate into economic outcomes in the months ahead,” Hughes said.
“This implies Irish consumer sentiment and the broader Irish economy may be approaching a pivot point that will see sentiment and spending growth deviate materially from their current paths and either rise or fall markedly depending on the course Brexit takes and the response of Irish and EU policymakers.”
The KBC Consumer Sentiment Survey is conducted monthly with a nationally representative sample of 1,000 adults.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-reaction-supreme-4822698-Sep2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said he “strongly disagrees” with the Supreme Court’s finding that he unlawfully suspended parliament, and says he thinks there’s a “good case” for another prorogation in the coming weeks.
This morning, the Supreme Court announced that the prorogation order was “unlawful, void and had no effect” and should be quashed – meaning that in law parliament has not been prorogued.
The judges ruled that Johnson’s advice to Queen Elizabeth II to suspend parliament for five weeks until 14 October was illegal.
The ruling is the worst outcome that the government could have hoped for. The decision has already prompted calls for Johnson to resign and House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has said parliament will return tomorrow.
Despite all that, Johnson was in bullish mood when reacting to the news today.
“I don’t think that it’s right but we will go ahead and of course parliament will come back,” he told reporters in New York this afternoon.
He also indicated that the current plan for the UK to leave the EU has not changed.
“On the contrary, as the law currently stands, the UK leaves the EU on 31 October come what may but the interesting thing, the exciting thing, for us now is to get a deal and that’s what we’re working on,” he said.
He added that he does think there’s a “good case for getting on with a Queen’s Speech anyway and we will do that”.
A Queen’s Speech is the ceremonial beginning of a parliament where Queen Elizabeth II outlines the priorities of the government.
Johnson said he made the decision to prorogue parliament to allow time to prepare for a Queen’s Speech. The basis for that has been found to be unlawful, but doesn’t rule out another prorogation in the coming days or weeks.
Johnson said: “I don’t think the justices remotely excluded the possibility of having a Queen’s speech but what we will certainly do is ensure parliament has plenty of time to debate Brexit.”

Parliament will now sit until the expected Queen’s Speech on 14 October. Any prorogation will only last for a few days to allow preparations be made.
The prime minister is expected to return to London earlier than planned so he can take up his position leading the government in the House of Commons tomorrow.
Johnson had been due to meet with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in New York today. Speaking to reporters, the Taoiseach said that meeting is still due to go ahead.

‘Consider his position’
Speaker Bercow announced earlier that parliament would reconvene in the Commons at 11.30am tomorrow morning, while the upper House of Lords said it would return the same day.
The judges “have vindicated the right and duty of parliament to meet at this crucial time to scrutinise the executive”, Bercow said.
Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the main opposition Labour party, led calls for the prime minister to step down.
“I invite Boris Johnson, in the historic words, to consider his position, and become the shortest serving prime minister there has ever been,” he told his party’s annual conference.
He brought forward his concluding speech to the meeting in Brighton, southern England, from tomorrow to today to allow him to be in Westminster.
Some opposition MPs called for a confidence vote in Johnson, and Bercow indicated that he would allow time for this if a formal request were made.
“I think Boris Johnson should resign,” Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon told Sky News television.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/simon-coveney-opinion-no-deal-brexit-4777187-Aug2019/,"TODAY MARKS THE 10-week point until Brexit. The manner in which the UK government chooses to leave the EU after 47-years of membership is still undecided despite 27 other countries dedicating more than two and a half years to negotiations centred around British red lines.
The possibility of the UK choosing to leave the EU without a deal is still very real and so in Ireland we cannot take our minds off preparations.
There are few contingency plans that will totally cancel out the damage of a no deal Brexit, there are merely mitigation measures to soften the blow.
‘Ugly and difficult’
A hard Brexit, if the UK chooses one, will be ugly and difficult. That is why we need businesses to ensure that the next 70-days are used to be as ready as they can be.
The government’s central portal for this isgov.ie/brexit. Here businesses will find the first steps to the training and supports available across the country. Customs training has been particularly well attended in recent weeks for firms trading with the UK who haven’t had to complete customs declarations before.
The Revenue Commissioners have also spoken by phone with an additional 10,000 businesses to get them an EORI number, without which a firm will not be able to trade with the UK.
There are nine steps that all businesses, large and small, should take now:
It feels a bit strange for me to have to keep stating this, but I have read some commentary this week that was vague, to say the least, on the fact that Ireland will remain a fully committed EU member state after Brexit.
That is the country’s number one contingency, our EU membership and all of the security and support it brings.
Simply put, Irish businesses will continue to have full access to the biggest single market in the world after Brexit, UK businesses will not. Our EU membership is the cornerstone of our economy and that will not be changing.

Leaving the single market and customs union is the UK’s choice.
Overnight change for the UK
The deal negotiated between the UK and EU gives British business the transition period until 2021 where everything would stay the same while a future trade deal is being negotiated. If the UK government and Westminster chooses a hard Brexit and rejects that deal, then they reject this transition period and choose overnight change.
Therefore, a like for like comparison between the UK and Ireland on no deal preparation is somewhat redundant as we will not be starting from scratch in Ireland. Our EU membership will be there in the case of a hard Brexit and that will bring vital supports for the most exposed and worst hit sectors.
We will not be dragged out of the single market and customs union for convenience and will protect our EU membership.
I said at the start of July that our work with the European Commission on the twin objectives of protecting Ireland’s place in our single market whilst also preventing infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is happening.
Inferior backstop alternatives
That work, for the case of no deal, is ongoing and there are no easy answers. What is apparent is that any answers we find will be far inferior to the backstop and will badly hit the all-island economy.
That is why the backstop and the Withdrawal Agreement are so heavily supported in Northern Ireland. In fact, I have been struck in recent meetings and by recent polls that showed me support for the backstop in Northern Ireland, a part of the UK, has grown in recent months among all sectors and communities.
The backstop is overwhelmingly supported by business, farmers, unions and employers in Northern Ireland. This gets very little recognition in the Brexit debate in the UK.
A lot can happen in politics in ten-weeks, but ten-weeks is a very short time in business.
The time for a ‘wait and see’ approach has passed for business. Companies, particularly small and medium enterprises, need to act but they are not alone. There are multi million Euro supports available including training, grants, loans and expertise on mapping supply chains and markets.
If your business hasn’t taken the first steps on being Brexit ready, the state agencies and EU supports are there for you. The time to act is now.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-backstop-simon-coveney-michel-barnier-meeting-boris-4826599-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|27 Sep 2019
TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has warned that “time is running out” to reach a withdrawal agreement following a meeting with chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels this afternoon.
With no serious progress made on the issue of the Irish backstop and the border, concerns are growing that a deal cannot be secured before the Brexit deadline of 31 October.
“There are still significant gaps between both sides,” Coveney said this afternoon after his meeting with Barnier.
“The clear message that I would have got from Michel Barnier today is that his team and he himself are available 24/7 to negotiate towards trying to get a deal done.
“But that has to be on the basis of a serious proposal coming forward from the UK side. That hasn’t happened yet. And until there is a serious proposal in writing that can be the basis for negotiation then the gaps that are wide at the moment will remain.”
Said Coveney: “Time is running out. We need to move this process on but, really, the onus is on the British Prime Minister and his team to allow that to happen by putting serious proposals on the table that the EU can negotiate around to try and find a way of getting a deal done here.”
On 20 September, the UK Brexit minister Stephen Barclay met with Barnier and submitted three papers with ideas on replacing the backstop.
“There is significant work still to do but there are serious discussions that are taking place,” Barclay said after those talks. However, the Irish government and the EU have been less optimistic about progress towards securing a deal.
In a short meeting between Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson in New York earlier this week, Varadkar said that there was still a“very wide gap”between what the UK is proposing and what the EU wants to achieve.
Meanwhile, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker has said it will be Britain’s responsibility if a withdrawal agreement is not reached with the EU.
In an interview with German newspaper Augsburger Allgemeine, Juncker said he and EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier are “working hard” to reach a deal and said it would be “a disaster” for the UK and EU if one is not reached.
“For an exit of the British from the EU without agreement would be a disaster for the United Kingdom and for the European continent,” Juncker said.

Given the political chaos in Britain at present, it remains possible for the UK to leave without a deal on 31 October.
Juncker added that negotiations on a future trade relationship between Britain and the EU would be complicated by a disorderly Brexit.
He said: “We want to and need to sign a free trade agreement.”
Today’s meeting between Coveney and Barnier comes following a torrid week for Johnson.
On Tuesday, the UK Supreme Courtruled that hisdecision to suspend parliament was unlawful and void, triggering an early return to Westminster for MPs and setting up a fiery day of debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday.
Opposition MPs have vowed to ensure that Johnson is forced to comply with the Benn Act, which forces the government to seek an extension from the EU if a deal hasn’t been secured by 19 October.
Coveney today repeated that the any solution put forward by the UK government must “must avoid a hard border, fully protect the Good Friday Agreement and North-South cooperation, and preserve the all-island economy”.
“To date there is nothing else on the table that achieves the same outcome as the backstop,” he said.
Coveney said that at the moment “the focus is on trying to get a deal quite frankly” but added that “the focus will shift to whether or not an extension is appropriate”.
Coveney added that “there would need to be good reason” for an extension, however.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-hulk-juncker-4810963-Sep2019/,"SIX WEEKS AFTER taking office, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will meet with EU Commission president Jean-Claude Junker in Luxembourg today.
After comparing the UK tocomic book super-smasher Hulk, Johnson will enjoy a genteel working lunch with Juncker.
The meeting comes just over six weeks ahead of the proposed Brexit date with Johnson again insisting today that the UK is preparing to leaving without a deal. It is the first meeting between the new PM and the outgoing commission president.
Downing Street has confidently billed the today’s visit as part of efforts to negotiate an orderly divorce from the union before an 17 October EU summit.
But Brussels has played down talk of a breakthrough, insisting Johnson has yet to suggest any “legally operable” proposal to revise a previous withdrawal accord.
Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, who will join the leaders for their talks in Juncker’s native Grand Duchy, has said he has “no reason to be optimistic”.
And the European Parliament will this week vote on a resolution rejecting Johnson’s demand that the backstop clause be stripped from the deal.
Johnson insists this measure, which temporarily effectively keeps the UK in the EU customs union, has to go if he is to bring the agreement back to the House of Commons.
But the accord will also have to win the support of the other 27 EU leaders and the European Parliament if Britain is not to crash out with no deal on 31 October.
Johnson, in turn, boasts that he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than ask his European counterparts to postpone Brexit for a third time into next year.
“Be in no doubt that if we cannot get a deal — the right deal for both sides — then the UK will come out anyway,” Johnson said, writingin the Daily Telegraph today.
It is difficult, then, to see what might come from the lunch, which will be held behind closed doors with no plan for a joint statement afterwards.

A fortnight ago, the House of Commons passed a law that compels Johnson to seek a Brexit extension if no deal can be reached butDowning Street is reportedly looking at legal loopholesthat would allow them avoid such an obligation.
Johnson’s meeting with Junker comes 26 days after he met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. At that meeting, Johnson had embracedMerkel’s mention of a 30-dayperiod as a timeline to find an alternative to the backstop.
No firm alternative has been raised so far.
‘Hulk smash!’
Nevertheless, Johnson told the Mail on Sunday he remains “very confident” of getting a new deal before the 17 October summit.
“A huge amount of progress is being made,” he said, referring to “technical talks” on border procedures between his Brexit adviser David Frost and Barnier’s team.
Speaking to the BBC Sunday, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay indicated that any post-Brexit transition period could be extended past 2020 in order to resolve issues with the border.
Johnson compared the UK to Marvel comics hero Hulk, the rampaging mutant alter-ego of a mild-mannered nuclear scientist.
“The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets and he always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be,” Johnson told the paper.
The comparison was labelled as “infantile” by the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt who likened it to something US Donald President Donald Trump would say.
The Belgian MEPtweeted:
Also on the Brexit front, theUK’s Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith travels to Dublin todaywhere he will speak about the ongoing impasse and efforts to restore Northern Ireland’s power-sharing executive.
Smith is due to meet with Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney as well as Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan.

THE MAYOR OF Belfast has said the Irish government must lead the way in making plans and preparations for Irish unification.
Speaking to the MacGill Summer School this evening, Sinn Fein’s John Finucane said the debate about Irish unity does not just belong to Sinn Féin, but to everyone on the island.
He called on the Irish government to set up a unit within government to begin preparations for the possibility of Irish unity, highlighting that the Scottish government has done so.
The Belfast mayor also called for an Oireachtas committee on Irish unity to be established. He also called on the Taoiseach to “appoint an Minister of State with the dedicated and specific responsibility of developing strategies to advance Irish unity and coordinating the Government’s all-Ireland policies”.
Finucane said there is “no reason why not preparatory work cannot be done now” adding, “make no mistake this is happening”.
“A unity referendum is coming, and we must prepare for it,” he said.
He said too many frame the discussion around Irish unity as “a distant aspiration” adding often people state that it is “never the right time to talk about it”.
Speaking about the unionist community, he said many are looking at Brexit with the same trepidation as nationalists.
He said “it is time to hear all voices in this debate”, adding that there is now a need to “persuade” people on the benefits of unification.

His comments come as another Northern Ireland politician said a border poll post-Brexit is premature.
Speaking at the MacGill Summer School in Donegal, Claire Hanna, SDLP MLA for South Belfast said “calls now for a border poll are like removing the scaffolding before the structures are built”.
She added that a border poll “should be the last, and not first piece of the jigsaw”.
The summer school was also told by another speaker that if it comes down to getting a United Ireland over the line, Ireland will rejoin the Commonwealth.
Last weekend, Ireland’s Ambassador to the UK said a poll on a united Ireland would “degrade” attempts to resolve the ongoing impasse over Britain’s departure from the EU.
Adrian O’Neill toldBBC Radio 4′s The Week in Westminsterprogramme that the current priority for the Irish government was to restore the Northern Ireland Executive at Stormont.

There has been speculation that Britain leaving the European Union could eventually lead to the unification of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
A border poll
Last year, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said a no-deal Brexit would bring the timeline for aborder poll on a united Irelandforward, whilea numberof public pollshave also suggested some support for the idea should such a scenario occur.
However, asked whether he agreed with recent comments by Conservative MP David Liddington that pressure was mounting for a border poll because of Brexit, O’Neill said:
This week,TheJournal.iealso reported thatFianna Fáil’s 12-point planon a United Ireland is still being worked on, though it has been two and a half years since party leader Micheál Martin announced the document.
Hanna said today that some advances between the North and South have been made, in areas such as health and energy, but she said more could be done in the areas of economic development, third level education and transport.
She said the Irish government cannot “risk crossing the wires” of Brexit and a United Ireland.
“To put the foot hard on the pedal for reunification as a direct consequence of Brexit is to risk repeating the lasting, profound and mirror image mistake of the past, simply a rerun of the last century and of an unhappy minority trapped. Our modern, pluralist new Ireland will not be built on a narrow electoral win slipped through in a period of chaos,” she said.
She added that it took two decades of engagement to get to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, stating that any re-unification, even if a poll was passed, would not be smooth sailing.
“Any change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland isn’t going to be a 1997 Hong Kong type situation, where there was a defined date for a change of sovereignty and a neat ceremonial handing over of the flag,” she added.
Denis Bradley, the former vice-chair of the Northern Ireland’s Policing Authority, told the audience today, that Ireland has now escaped the worst of Brexit, due to the EU stating that no trade deal would be negotiated until the Irish issue is resolved.
He said a border poll is a “crude” method, as has been shown with the Brexit referendum. However, he said that unionists will not move on the issue, unless there this “crude instrument” is used.
Terrified of the conversation
An all-island forum on re-unification is probably needed sooner rather than later. Though the Irish government appears to be terrified of putting Brexit and unity together, Bradley said there is now no choice but to do so.
Bradley added it is “becoming annoying listening to half-baked theories that nationalist people had given up their unity aspirations and were now fully content within the new Northern Ireland or equally to hear the voice of dissident republicans continue the juvenile mantra that all would be well once the Brits had been forced out of Ireland”.
He said that nationalists “want to have the conversation” about unity, but added that unionism is “terrified” to even begin the debate. Who should lead that conversation? Bradley said Fianna Fáil are coming out as favourites to begin the discussion, but added that might be a question for Micheál Martin later today.
The Fianna Fáil leader is due to address the summer school later this evening.
He added that nothing that unionism asks for will be refused in order to get a United Ireland over the line, stating that many politicians state that Ireland would never join the Commonwealth, but Bradley states that Ireland will compromise and join it.

Time is rapidly running out if there is to be an agreement to put to EU leaders to sign off on at their two-day summit starting on Thursday.

The sticking point remains the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop intended to guarantee there is no return of a hard border with the Republic.
It has raised the prospect that negotiations could carry on after this week, with the possibility of an emergency EU summit at the end of the month to finally approve any 11th hour agreement.
If Boris Johnson cannot get a deal by the weekend, he will come under intense pressure to seek a further Brexit delay, something he has vowed not to do.

THE GOVERNMENT WILL ramp-up plans for a no-deal Brexit following what it sees as the “increasing risk” that Britain will leave the European Union without a deal.
Ministers will review Brexit preparations within their departments and relevant agencies after Cabinet met last night for an update on negotiations between the EU and UK.
The Government’s position on contingency mitigation and preparations for a no-deal Brexit was also discussed by Ministers, who agreed that planning for such an outcome would be given “top priority” across all departments and agencies.
A number of exercises will now take place in coming weeks to help the Government refine its preparations and inform its approach to emergency crisis management in the event that Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will also bring a memo to Government shortly on his Budget preparations, including the implications of a no-deal Brexit scenario.
“Notwithstanding the full range of preparations and mitigation measures in place, a no-deal Brexit risks potentially severe impacts in a number of areas,” the Government said in a statement.
This afternoon, Tánaiste Simon Coveney attended an Enterprise Ireland event to prepare businesses for Brexit, where he told reporters that the UK already had a Brexit deal.
Hinting at a possible snap election in the UK, he also said that if the UK was to seek an extension of Article 50 beyond 31 October, the government would have to make a case to do so.
“If there’s an extension looked for, then I think whichever Prime Minister asks for that will need to make a persuasive case as to how that extension can be used to get a deal,” he said.
The Tánaiste added that if the British government wanted a new deal, they would also have to offer alternative proposals to the current withdrawal agreement.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Moments later onRTÉ Radio 1′s News at One, Coveney was asked whether any such proposals by the British government were forthcoming.

Worst-case scenario
This morning, Agriculture Minister Michael Creed announced the extension of the closing date for the Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) and outlined plans for further support to assist farmers in making their applications online.
The online application process was opened on 19 August and was scheduled to close on Sunday 8 September but this has been extended to midnight on Sunday 15September.
Earlier on Morning Ireland, Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection Regina Doherty said the Government was being left with “no choice” but to prepare for the UK’s departure from the EU without a deal.
However, she insisted that the Government had not accepted that such a scenario was inevitable.
“There’s a fine line between accepting that 57 days out that we will have no deal… and still working tirelessly every single day that we want a deal,” she said.
“We want the United Kingdom to fulfil their ambition to leave the European Union, but with a deal – a trade deal that actually protects the relationship of trade between North and South.”
Doherty also suggested that the Government was available to discuss alternatives to the current withdrawal agreement agreed between the UK and the EU.
“We haven’t lost sight of that,” she added. “Yes, we’re preparing for worst-case-scenario, but also working really hard to make sure that that doesn’t materialise.”
Her comments follow a vote by UK MPsto debate a bill todaythat would extend the current Brexit deadline from 31 October to 31 January at the earliest.
MPs now have the chance to pass all stages of the bill today, but British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to table a motion for a general election – to be held on 14 October – because he will not accept the bill.
“I don’t want an election. The public don’t want an election,” he said last night.
“But if the House votes for this bill… the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on October 17 to sort this out and take this country forward.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/house-of-commons-returns-4792173-Sep2019/,"THE HOUSE OF Commons is back today, and if you thought that previous Prime Minister’s Questions were dramatic, we’re in for absolute showstoppers this week.
The fractured British parliament resumes after a five-week summer recess to debate Brexit and prorogation, to propose Brexit legislation, and possibly trigger a general election – as well as other non EU-exit related topics, of course.
When the British parliament broke on 25 July, subsequent weekend columns suggested that MPs were in need of rest and recuperation, which could do wonders to stimulate new ideas to manoeuvre through this Brexit impasse.
But we’re not sure how rested they’ll be: MPs learned last week that they would lose at least two weeks of parliamentary time to propose legislation and debate Brexit. House Speaker John Bercow was revived from his family holiday to launch a blistering attack on the prorogation decision, stating that it was “blindingly obvious” that it was an attempt to block future Brexit debates.
The queen granted Johnson’s request to prorogue parliament from 9-12 September until 14 October; the UK parliament would have been suspended for three weeks of that time for the political parties to hold their annual conferences (though it had been suggested that some MPs would vote to postpone this due to the bubbling Brexit crisis).
What’s he up to?
So what has Boris Johnson got planned? Since being appointed PM, he’s faced his parliament for just one day before proroguing it; he’s due to host a keenly anticipated Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs), where we’re expected he’ll be verbally eviscerated by MPs on all sides of the House for that decision. PMQs kick off at noon tomorrow.
Later today, he’ll face a crucial vote that Johnson is expected to treat as a confidence motion.
Opposition members are to attempt to take control of parliamentary business from the government in a vote that some rebel Tories may also support, particularly after Johnson’s prorogation manoeuvre.
If this is successful, a motion to prevent a no-deal Brexit could be tabled, and Johnson is expected to call a general election.
Yesterday, ahead of the cabinet being gathered early and a snap No 10 announcement, many wondered whether the long-ago forecasted general election was coming into view.

An election must be held 25 days after a no-confidence vote or the dissolution of parliament; meaning if it were prompted this week, the 17 October is the most like date for polling day, as its the first Thursday after that, which is the weekday UK elections are usually held.
Instead though, Johnsonannounceda Treasury spending plan:
“And so I am proud to say that on Wednesday Chancellor Sajid Javid is going to set out the most ambitious spending round for more than a decade.”
These include  20,000 police officers, 20 new hospital upgrades and increasing funding in primary and secondary schools, according to Johnson.
Before you read between the lines, Johnson has said he doesn’t want a general election, and wouldn’t be requesting an extension in any circumstances.
Remainer sources told Sky News and ITV yesterday that they expect Johnson to put down a dissolution motion that would call an election, with what appears to be a “reasonable” polling date before 31 October. But after MPs vote for it (Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would back a call for an election), Johnson would then use prerogative proclamation power to move polling day to after 31 October.
The day before the prorogation ruckus, British opposition parties agreed to prioritise no-deal Brexit legislation over a no-confidence vote, which was Corbyn’s preferred battle strategy. This week, we find out if they stick to it, having been provoked by prorogation.
A taste of the action
The House of Commons kicks of with oral questions today on topical foreign and commonwealth affairs questions, census legislation and will hear the implications of a no-deal Brexit on the UK’s sheep industry.
Westminster Hall will hear about the EU Settlement Scheme, while British committees return – interestingly the Foreign Affairs Committee will begin by looking at ‘Autocracies and UK Foreign Policy’.
On Thursday, the Northern Ireland Affairs committee will consult on implementing the Stormont House Agreement, and the Home Affairs committee will be asked about Brexit preparations in the Thatcher Room.
The Treasury committee will discuss the UK’s economic relationship with the EU, and the European Scrutiny committee will ask about ‘Post-Brexit Scrutiny of EU Law and Policy’.
At 2.45pm, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee will ask the very pointed question of: “Is the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs ready for Brexit?”

Boris Johnson will now have to bring his deal before parliament.Stefan Rousseau / PA Wire/PA ImagesStefan Rousseau / PA Wire/PA Images / PA Wire/PA Images
THE UK AND EU have agreed a new Brexit deal after intense negotiations, which UK prime minister Boris Johnson hailed as an agreement that “takes back control”.
The revised version of the Withdrawal Agreement was reached just in time for a crucial EU summit being held today and tomorrow.
The agreement, which was announced by Johnson and the EU this morning, comes after days of back-and-forth negotiations between the two sides.
After weeks of speculation about a no-deal Brexit or a possible extension, Johnson will now present the deal to the House of Commons on Saturday for the approval of MPs.
The vote will prove crucial to determining if the UK leaves the EU on 31st of October, as Johnson has repeatedly promised. British parliamentarians voted three times against Theresa May’s deal, largely over objections to the backstop on Northern Ireland.
If MPs do vote against it, Johnson may be forced to seek an extension, as mandated by the Benn Act – passed by MPsagainst the wishesof the government in September.
Johnson will now hope that his new plan on Northern Ireland, which will see the region aligned to some EU rules but inside the UK customs territory, will prove acceptable to hardline Brexiteers in his own party.
‘Certainty’
Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, stressed the “certainty” the deal provided during a press conference this morning.
“This agreement should provide legal certainty in every area where Brexit like any separation creates uncertainty and in particular and first and foremost for European citizens in the UK and British citizens living in one of our member states. These citizens have always been and will remain our priority,” he said.

“Throughout these negotiations, the EU and the UK were fully committed to protecting peace and stability on the island of Ireland,” Barnier added.
“Discussions over the past days have at times been difficult, but we have delivered. And we have delivered together.”
Barnier said that he thought the deal could be ratified by the European Parliament and approved by the European Council before the 31 October – the day the UK is set to leave the EU.
He added that Johnson had told President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker , that he had “confidence in his ability” to win the vote in the House of Commons.
The deal comes after theDUP this morning rejectedthe revised agreement’s proposals for customs and Stormont consent.
In a statement this afternoon, the DUP confirmed its opposition to the deal.
“Following confirmation from the Prime Minister that he believes he has secured a “great new deal” with the European Union, the DUP will be unable to support these proposals in parliament,” the party said in a statement.
Juncker called it a “fair and balanced” agreement.
In a letter to Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, Juncker wrote: “I believe it is high time to complete the withdrawal process and move on, as swiftly as possible, to the negotiation on the European Union’s future partnership with the United Kingdom”.

What’s changed?
Thenew dealwill be discussed at the EU summit, before the rare Saturday sitting of parliament.
The important differences are the arrangements to replace the backstop.
Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a set of EU rules. On the issue of customs, there will still be a customs and regulatory border on the Irish sea. British authorities can apply tariffs to goods entering the UK , as long as goods entering Northern Ireland are not at risk of crossing the border and entering the single market.
If goods are going to enter the single market by travelling across the border from the North across the border into Ireland, EU tariffs will be applied.
The role of Stormont in deciding Northern Ireland’s regulations, one of the sticking points for the DUP, was described by Barnier as a “cornerstone of the newly agreed approach”.
While more details are expected on the exact consent arrangements from the UK side, Barnier spelled out today what exactly the new deal means for Northern Ireland, which is set to be worst affected economically by Brexit.
After four years of the agreement coming into force, a simple majority of the Northern Ireland Assembly will have to decide whether to continue or not with the customs and regulatory arrangements.
This change will prevent the DUP using the petition of concern mechanism to veto the measures designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland – a decision that appears to have proven unacceptable to the Arlene Foster’s party.
If the Assembly does reject the arrangement, there will be a two-year cooling off period, during which the UK and the EU would work on a new approach to customs and regulations.
Barnier said that members of the Assembly every four years will “bear the responsibility of maintaining the system or breaking it off”.
“We now have to place trust in the system and those who will be managing it,” he said.
Challenges
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn told Sky News this morning that his party will be voting against the deal. The agreement, he said, “doesn’t meet our demands or expectations”.

While Labour opposition was expected, gaining approval in the House of Commons could still prove difficult for Johnson, who does not currently have a majority. To do so, he may need to rely on the votes of former Tory MPs expelled from his party, as well as on some rebel Labour MPs.
It will prove particularly difficult as the DUP, which repeatedly defeated Theresa May’s attempts to pass a deal, said it would reject this latest deal.

“The DUP has worked since the referendum result to secure a negotiated deal as we leave the European Union. We have been consistent that we will only ever consider supporting arrangements that are in Northern Ireland’s long-term economic and constitutional interests and protect the integrity of the Union,” the party said in a statement.

Senior cabinet member Michael Gove, speaking to Sky News, said that the deal was not a betrayal of the DUP. “This is a great deal,” he said.
Responding to the deal, leader of the Scottish National Party Nicola Sturgeon, said that the deal would “take Scotland out of the European Union, out of the single market and out of the customs union against the overwhelming democratic will of the people of Scotland”.
“This is not the future that I or my government envisage for Scotland,” she said.
There will still be a transition period until the end of 2020 if the deal is passed this weekend.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who has played a central role in the wider discussions over Brexit and the backstop, told reporters in Brussels today that the deal was a “good” one for Ireland.
“The backstop has been replaced, it’s been replaced by a new solution for Northern Ireland, recognising its unique history and geography but that new solution does what we need it to do, avoids a hard border between north and south,” Varadkar said.
“[It] protects the all-island economy, protects the single market and our place in it and also, and we were happy to accept this, takes account of the democratic wishes of the people of Northern Ireland,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/beef-farmers-brexit-michael-creed-negotiations-ifa-4761969-Aug2019/,"THE IRISH FARMERS’ Association (IFA) has said that retailers and the EU Commission must be part of discussions between the meat industry and the Beef Plan Movement.
Talkswill take placetoday aimed at ending the ongoing dispute over beef prices.
“While the factories are the main problem, the retailer has a dominant role in the dysfunctional food chain that is not working for beef farmers. They need to be around the table tomorrow to account for their actions and to outline how they intend to address the problem,” IFA President Joe Healy said.

Speaking at the Tullamore Show, Healy said that the EU Commission must explain why it’s allowing imports to threaten the EU beef market.
“New EU legislation on the Agri Markets Task Force needs to be implemented here. It will require a new state agency with robust oversight and resources to enforce it,” he added.
Over the past couple of weeks, multiple protests organised by the Beef Plan Movement have taken place in 22 sites across the country. The group has been set up by farmers who argue that they’re not getting value for money for their cattle.
Talks between Meat Industry Ireland and the group were announced lateon Fridayevening – all protests will be suspended until the talks have concluded.
The IFA is also calling for the immediate payout of the€100 million Brexitcompensation package for beef and suckler farmers announced in July.

Also speaking at the Tullamore Show, IFA Treasurer Tim Cullinan said that the industry is in “free fall”.
“If the €100m Brexit fund is paid out immediately it will put some confidence into mart sales and store prices,” he said.
“The announcement of a €100 million Brexit fund was late coming in the first place, given the scale and duration of the beef crisis, and any further delay is intolerable and unnecessary,” Cullinan added.

LEO VARADKAR HAS said that in the two years that he has been Taoiseach, it had crossed his mind that he could get a phone call in the middle of the night, asking him to compromise in order to secure a Brexit deal.
Speaking to reporters in Brussels, the Taoiseach said: “Well I’ll be very frank with you, in dealing with this issue for over two years, it always crossed my mind that that might arise, that someday that I would get that phone call or find myself late at night being put under pressure from other European leaders and other European countries to compromise.
“And it certainly was never an anti-British thing, but of course if one country is leaving and another staying, there would be solidarity among the 27 and the European family.
Referring to European leaders as “the 27 muskateers, all for one and one for all”,  the Taoiseach added: “When it sticks together it’s very powerful – I think we demonstrated that when it comes to Brexit, the way the 27 have stuck together and defended each other’s interests.”
He said that he hoped and expected that “this should continue as we enter other negotiations, whether it’s with Turkey, whether it’s with the United States or China into the future, and even if we get past this next phase of Brexit – Brexit isn’t over”.

The queen will still be the queen
When asked what message he would have for unionists, who feared this deal damaged Northern Ireland’s position within the United Kingdom, Varadkar replied that there is already a difference in the legal system, education system, and laws and rules.
“The fact that there may be differences in Northern Ireland, doesn’t undermine the constitutional position, in my view,” he said.
He continued:
The Taoiseach also acknowledged that the UK would become a competitor of Ireland’s but said that there were other countries where “we’re competitors, and also partners”.
“We’re very strong partners with the Netherlands, yet we’re forever competing for business with Amsterdam, so it’s possible to be both competitor and partner at the same time.”
The backstop
Leo Varadkar also explained that the backstop was a mechanism that was “never intended for use” and that would apply temporarily unless and until it was superseded by alternative arrangements.

“What we have now is a new solution, one that is very likely to be used, and one that is more permanent, but essentially what we are saying – and we have accepted along the way that this would be an outcome that we would accept – is that we would allow people of Northern Ireland and their democratic representatives, their members their Assembly to determine their future.”
The arrangements keep Northern Ireland in the UK’s customs territory, meaning they would avail of any new UK trade deals, but would also be aligned to the EU’s Customs Union.
In practice, this would mean that if goods are sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, no tariffs apply. If goods are sent from GB through Northern Ireland to Ireland, tariffs will apply, but they will be collected at ports and airports – effectively putting a customs border along the Irish Sea. For goods sent from Ireland to Northern Ireland, there would be no tariffs, and for goods travelling from Ireland through Northern Ireland to Great Britain, there would be tariffs collected at the Irish Sea customs border.
If the Withdrawal Agreement is passed by the House of Commons, this arrangement will come into effect at the end of the transition period, which will end in December 2020 (or December 2022 if it’s extended). Four years after that, the Northern Ireland Assembly will get a vote on whether to keep this customs arrangement, or default to WTO rules.
“Essentially what this new arrangement,” Varadkar said, “this new solution allows is for the Northern Ireland Assembly after four years to decide whether or not it wants to continue with these arrangements.
“So there is of course an outside chance that at some point in the latter part of the next decade… [an] assembly might decide to opt out of alignment, opt out of the single electricity market, opt out of the new customs arrangement.
“But if there’s a risk we’re taking, the risk we’re taking is one on democracy and saying to people in Northern Ireland that you determine your future and this is something I can stand over.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-traffic-dublin-port-4717897-Jul2019/,"A TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT plan to deal with potential chaos around Dublin Port in the scenario of a no-deal Brexit will be in place by 31 October.
A document updating Ireland’s contingency planning for Brexit state that in a crash-out Brexit, goods entering the EU from the UK will be treated as if they come from a third country and will subject to customs declarations.
“Additional checks and controls” will be required on UK imports and exports, it adds.
In order facilitate the trucks that may need inspection, facilities such as a 6,000 square metre warehouse has been converted so it can accommodate 13 inspection bays.
In light of the possible delays inspections may cause, a traffic management group has been set up for Dublin Port, which is tasked to consider the potential “knock-on impacts on the wider area of city traffic.
Officials state they want to have “minimal disruption” to traffic in and around the Port Tunnel area as well as the East Link Bridge.
Advertisement
A communications strategy has been drafted to deal with how to inform HGV drivers where to go in the case where there is build-up at Dublin Port.
Every day, about 10,000 trucks travel through the tunnel, as well as about 15,000 cars. The Department of Transport has said it is “crucial” to keep HGV traffic away from the port if there is congestion.
Earlier in the year, the department was exploring whether it could park lorries at one of Dublin Airport’s long-term car parks to avoid possible traffic jams on routes into Dublin Port after Brexit.
However, it is understood that this idea has been discounted.
It is understood that Dublin City Council is working with the departmental group on the issue, in terms of how to communicate any such delays to commuters if they occur.
In order to avoid delays, the latest Brexit memo states, that “it is vital that industry prepares as fully as possible” and asks businesses to get up to speed on the documentation that it will need in order to pass through the port.
Those with all their documentation submitted “well in advance” will go through the ‘green’ route and will experience minimal delays, but those who do not have their custom papers in order will be stopped and possibly subject to physical inspections.
Officials have said it is difficult to estimate how many lorries might fall into this category, which is why traffic management plans for the area are needed.

“Absolutely not,” he said, when asked bySky Newsif he mislead the queen. He added that the High Court in England “agrees with us”, and that the Supreme Court would have to decide on the matter.
Johnson advised the queen to suspend parliament for five weeks until 14 October in order to wipe clean the legislative agenda. His critics, some of which are in his own party, said that this was an attempt to stifle parliamentary debate on Brexit.
Although prorogation is a normal parliamentary procedure, the length of the suspension and timing of it have led to concern among politicians, political experts and activists.
“We need a Queen’s Speech,” Johnson said today, “and parliament will have time, both before and after that crucial EU summit, to talk about the Brexit deal.”
In response to reports that No 10 had criticised a Scottish ruling (that his prorogation was “unlawful”) as being politically motivated, Johnson said: “It’s very important we respect the independence of the judiciary. They are learned people.”
Johnson said that Operation Yellowhammer document,which was officially released last night, was a “worst case scenario” (a UK Revenue officialsaid it was a likely worst case scenario, meaning it isn’t on the most extreme end of the scale.)
His government had been “massively accelerating” no-deal preparations since he became Prime Minister 50 days ago.
He said that his priority was still to get a deal:
“I think we can see the rough area of landing space of how you could do it. It will be tough, and it will be hard, but I think we can get there.”

After the idea raised its head again this week, the British Prime Minister also said today that he thinks a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland would be “very good”.
The ambitious proposal for such a link across the Irish Sea has beenmooted many times in the pastbut has never been seriously discussed.
Johnson raised it again in an interview with The Sunday Times early last year and the DUP has been supportive of the idea.
On Wednesday,Channel 4 News reportedthat UK government documents suggest that the feasibility of the project is to be explored and costed.
Referencing the idea todaywhile speaking to schoolchildren who wereon board a boat on the Thames, Johnson confirmed it was being considered.
“[I was talking yesterday] about building a bridge from Stranraer in Scotland to Larne in Northern Ireland – that would be very good. It would only cost about £15 billion,” he said.
Engineers have raised several major obstacles to such a bridge including the length of the crossing, unexploded WW2 munitions and the weather on the Irish Sea.

https://www.thejournal.ie/pachal-donohoe-brexit-backstop-4727492-Jul2019/,"THE BACKSTOP WILL remain in the Brexit withdrawal agreement, according to Finance and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe.
His comments come the day after Jeremy Hunt, a contender for the Tory leadership, proclaimed during a television debate with Boris Johnson that the backstop is “dead”.
When asked about the comments today, Donohoe said he had “followed what was said last night” during the debate.

He said “there may well be a change in personality and outlook in dealing with this issue but the Irish government and the EU on this issue are really clear that we are not going to be changing the content of the backstop agreement and that in any future scenario the backstop in the withdrawal agreement will be needed”.
“We will not be changing the backstop,” he added, stating that it is at the “heart” of the two-year negotiations which resulted in the withdrawal agreement.
If the customs infrastructure on the border is to be avoided, and the UK are taking the decision to exit the Customs Union “you need regulatory alignment and the backstop is simply a procedure for ensuring regulatory alignment in a variety of different circumstances and this reality will, I fear, become quickly apparent for any new UK colleagues that have to wrestle with this issue”, he said.
If there is to be regulatory alignment in both agriculture and health, that will “mean you need a backstop and that has been the reality we have had to grapple with for nearly three years and it is a realty that will confront any British prime minister”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/schrodingers-brexit-deal-feature-eu-summit-4855719-Oct2019/,"Gráinne Ní Aodha reports from Brussels:
AFTER A DRAMATIC morning, the throng of reporters were keen to hear from the Taoiseach.
But on his way into a pre-European Council meeting with his European party colleagues, just after midday yesterday, Leo Varadkar paused to tell the awaiting Irish media absolutelynothingabout the deal that had been agreed moments before his arrival.
There had been some initial reports that a deal had been agreed and the sticking issues of customs, consent, and VAT payments solved.
Then yesterday morning, ahead of the much-anticipated gathering of EU leaders for a Brussels summit, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that a deal had finally been done.
But Varadkar didn’t breathe any details.
I will brief the media later, he said, maintaining a tight-lipped approach he’d adopted since his meeting with Boris Johnson at Thornton Manor Estate, Cheshire last week.
That ‘secret’ meeting has been seen as a pivotal point in the negotiations – with officials from both sides saying it went far better than expected and helped lay the foundations for the deal struck yesterday.
Hours later, on the red carpet of Brussels’ Europa building, the Taoiseach was back to his forthright self.
“The backstop has been replaced,” he told Irish reporters, “it’s been replaced by a new solution, a unique solution for Northern Ireland… but that new solution does what we need it to do – avoids a hard border between North and South.”
On the subject of who had compromised, Varadkar insisted:
In the end, Ireland compromised its fair share.
Johnson had consistently criticised the backstop as “anti-democratic” and it’s been now erased from the Withdrawal Agreement, instead replaced with a customs arrangement that you’d imagine was inspired bySchrödinger’s cat(which demonstrated the problems with an interpretation of quantum physics with an example that claimed a cat could be simultaneously dead and alive).
Advertisement
This new customs arrangementeffectively aligns Northern Ireland with the EU’s customs union, while keeping it in the UK’s customs territory – meaning that if the UK does strike up new trade deals, the North would benefit from these.
Tariffs would be paid on goods that enter the EU single market by travelling across the land border in Ireland, but these tariffs could be rebated to businesses if the goods stayed in the North or re-entered Great Britain.
The UK also compromised, trampling over the red lines formerly laid down by the DUP, to allow for a regulatory border in the Irish Sea as well as a customs border (of sorts) at the Irish land border (as well as in the Irish Sea).
Democracy in Northern Ireland
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Throughout this process the phrase “a time limited backstop is not a backstop,” was repeated by the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Europe Minister of State Helen McEntee when they were asked whether there was room to compromise.
And although we haven’t a backstop to time-limit anymore, there’s still the same core problem: a solution to protect Northern Ireland that is time limited, limits that protection.
In order to get around the ‘democratic’ issue with the backstop, Northern Ireland has been given a new deadline of 2024, when it would vote to either keep the current customs arrangements, or to switch to a ‘hard Brexit’ scenario – effectively operating on WTO terms.
Concerns have been raised that this new mechanism simply kicks the can down the road for the people of the North and its politicians.
David Phinnemore a Professor of European Politics at Queen’s University Belfast, told a UK committee earlier this week that such a time-oriented consent mechanism would be “really problematic because the political cycle would be geared towards remaining in, or leaving”.
Added to that political uncertainty would be the inconvenient cost and administrative burden of adhering to two customs arrangements.
Dr Esmond Birnie, a senior economist at Ulster University said at the same committee that businesses could find themselves making considerable outlays before receiving their rebates.
He estimated that the rebates would total something in the order of £500 million per annum.
“Businesses would be up-front out-of-pocket for a considerable sum of money,” he said, adding that there would be a certain degree of administrative burden on their part to retrieve that money, too.
It must be remembered also that this consent mechanism wasn’t something the Irish government wanted – it was agreed to as a compromise and helped lead to this week’s deal. But the UK government’s compromise is likely to deal a blow to Northern Irish businesses.

Extension rebellion
When EU leaders were asked about the possibility of an extension, they all dismissed it as something that is out of their hands. There is no extension request from the UK, Juncker said dismissively. In a statement with Johnson later, Juncker said that the deal meant there was no need for “prolongation”, fuelling rumours that it was this deal or nothing.
But an extension is at least a distinct possibility, if not highly likely. If a vote on this new Brexit deal isn’t passed by 320 MPs in the House of Commons tomorrow during its ‘special sitting’, attention will turn to Johnson to request an extension, as required of him by the Benn Act.
It would have to be an extension for a specific reason, like an election, a referendum, or to revoke Article 50 entirely – but the EU is still highly likely to grant such a request.
If it were asked for, the EU would probably need to call another summit in order to get approval for an extension from the various member states. At that juncture, it’s possible there could be some kick-back against another delay from some quarters.
Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt, head of the EU Parliament’s Brexit Steering Group, has suggested holding a parliament vote after the 31 October, in order to allow enough time for the deal to be scrutinised.

At a joint-press conference between Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk, Michel Barnier, and Varadkar, all said that today was a sad day for them. As strange as that sounds, EU officials have been holding out hope that the UK would change its mind, and thought maybe that Brexit would never happen.
“I have infinite respect for the UK,” Michel Barnier said, and made a point of outlining his admiration for Boris Johnson’s historic hero, Winston Churchill.
Donald Tusk, outlining his “sadness” at the UK’s exit from the EU, said: “Deal is always better than no deal, but I am not happy because of the substance of this political fight.”
Juncker, meanwhile, was a flickering source of humour for the evening. “I am not in charge of Westminster, hesaid, when asked about whether the deal would pass.  ”I have to say, I am happy about the deal, but I am sad about Brexit.”
When all four European leaders were asked about what message they would have for those in the UK who voted to remain in the European Union, Juncker opted to fill the silence that followed.
“I would like to say to the 48%… that they were right.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/the-backstop-has-been-replaced-varadkar-hails-agreement-between-eu-and-uk-4855333-Oct2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has hailed the agreement reached between the UK and the EU for avoiding a hard border in Ireland.
Varadkar, who has played a key role during the Brexit talks as wrangling continued over the Northern Ireland backstop, said that the agreement is a “good” one for Ireland.
“I think it is a good agreement for Northern Ireland and Ireland and the wider European Union,” he said.
The backstop, he added, has been replaced with a new solution in this agreement.
“The backstop has been replaced, it’s been replaced by a new solution for Northern Ireland, recognising its unique history and geography but that new solution does what we need it to do, avoids a hard border between north and south,” the Taoiseach said.

“[It] protects the all-island economy, protects the single market and our place in it and also, and we were happy to accept this, takes account of the democratic wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.
“Because we’ve always expressed the view and said we would never seek to hold Northern Ireland in an arrangement for the long-term against the will of the people there.
The agreement will now need to be approved by the House of Commons. It’s not immediately clear whether British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who currently has no majority, will be able to secure the backing of MPs for his agreement.
The DUP has already said that itwill vote againstthe deal, which in short will see Northern Ireland inside the UK customs territory but still aligned to a set of EU rules.
After four years, MLAs in Stormont will also be able to vote by a simple majority on whether to continue with the customs and regulatory arrangements.
The EU today stressed the certainty of the deal and called the newly configured role of Stormont a“cornerstone”of the deal.
“This does now go to the House of Commons and they will consider the matter on Saturday and I think we should give them the time and space to make a decision for themselves about what they believe is the right think for the United Kingdom,” Varadkar said.

Questioned on the concessions made by the EU negotiators, Varadkar said that he had wanted a deal.
“I regret that they are leaving but we accept that they are leaving,” he said.
Varadkar and Johnson’s meeting in Wirral last week provided revived momentum ahead of the frantic, back-and-forth negotiations of recent days.
The revised version of the Withdrawal Agreement reached today just in time for a crucial EU summit being held today and tomorrow.

Irish Ambassador to the UK Adrian O’Neill says an Irish border poll would degrade the prospects of finding a way through on Brexit#WeekinWestminster[tap to expand]pic.twitter.com/3uOyfF4iCU— BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics)July 20, 2019BBC Politics/ Twitter
Irish Ambassador to the UK Adrian O’Neill says an Irish border poll would degrade the prospects of finding a way through on Brexit#WeekinWestminster[tap to expand]pic.twitter.com/3uOyfF4iCU
IRELAND’S AMBASSADOR TO the UK believes that a poll on a united Ireland would “degrade” attempts to resolve the ongoing impasse over Britain’s departure from the EU.
Adrian O’Neill toldBBC Radio 4′s The Week in Westminsterprogramme that the current priority for the Irish government was to restore the Northern Ireland Executive at Stormont.
There has been speculation that Britain leaving the European Union could eventually lead to the unification of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Last year, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said a no-deal Brexit would bring the timeline for aborder poll on a united Irelandforward, whilea numberof public pollshave also suggested some support for the idea should such a scenario occur.
However, asked whether he agreed with recent comments by Conservative MP David Liddington that pressure was mounting for a border poll because of Brexit, O’Neill said:

Tory leadership candidates Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, one of whom will become the UK’s next Prime Minister this week, have both said they would be willing to leave the EU without a deal.
The scenario would bring about a return to a hard border and customs checks on the island of Ireland.
Hunt and Johnson have also criticised the so-called backstop, which would ensure Northern Ireland’s regulatory alignment with Ireland to avoid a hard border, and called for it to be removed from the EU withdrawal agreement.
However, O’Neill told BBC that he believed there could still be a breakthrough in negotiations, and said that efforts to shift blame for a no-deal Brexit to Ireland would not be credible.
“It was the British people in a referendum who narrowly decided on the principle of leaving the European Union,” he said.
“It was a British government that decided on the negotiating red lines of leaving the customs union and the single market…
“And it was the British parliament that has declined to approve the agreement that was negotiated by the British government with the European Union.
“So if you take all of those three circumstances together, it seems to be a rather odd conclusion that it’s the EU that’s the blame.”
Britain is currently set to leave the European Union on 31 October.

Leave.EU / TwitterLeave.EU / Twitter/ Twitter
BREXIT PARTY MEP Ann Widdecombe has stood by her remarks that compared the UK leaving the European Union to “slaves” rising up “against their owners”.
Widdecombe made the comparison, which has since been described as “disgusting”, during her first speech in the European Parliament.
The former Conservative party MP said the need for Britain to leave the union was confirmed after the recent negations among heads of state over who should get the EU’s top jobs.
“It is not democratic at all and that is just one of many reasons why Britain is right to be leaving this place, hopefully on Halloween,” she said.
EU leaders had been haggling since Sunday evening over who should fill the union’s four most important roles over the next five years, reaching an agreement on Tuesday.
“If that is this place’s idea of democracy than that it is a serious betrayal of every country that is represented here, Widdecombe said, going on to compare Brexit to liberation.
“There is a pattern consistent throughout history of oppressed people turning on the oppressors.
“And it doesn’t matter which language you use, we are going and we are glad to be going,” she said.

Speaking toBBC’S Newsnight,the former Tory MP said she stood by her comments.
“If people want to interpret what I’ve said in a particular way, that is not my responsibility.
“I said we’d been oppressed, I stand by that. I used three examples, not just slavery. I could have used four, five or six but I only had 90 seconds,” Widdecombe said.
‘Disgusting’
German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen was nominated for the role of President of the European Commission by EU leaders, but will only be able to take it up if a majority of MEPs vote in favour of her.
Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel will replace Donald Tusk as Council President – his role does not need to be ratified by the European Parliament.
Widdecombe’s comments today followed a speech by Tusk asking parliament to back the nomination of von der Leyen.
“Nigel Farage is facing some stiff competition as chief clown of the Brexit Party in the [European Parliament],”Guy Verhofstadt, the Brexit coordinator for the parliament, tweeted.
“By the way, when Widdecombe talks about ‘colonies liberating themselves from their empires’, is she really referring to the American Revolution of 1776?” Verhofstadt said.
Labour MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan tweeted: “It is disgusting that Ann Widdecombe would reference slavery and colonisation to describe our relationship with the EU.
“Her and Farage are bankrolled by elites – she’s part of the establishment which has created such a divide in this country.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/katy-hayward-backstop-northern-ireland-4804468-Sep2019/,"NOT FOR THE first time in the Brexit process, there’s a strong sense of ‘déjà vu’ in the air.
Also familiar at this stage is the accompanying feeling of bewilderment.
In this case, it is the Northern Ireland-specific backstop. Except we’re not going to hear it called the ‘backstop’ – if anyone wants it to have even a glimmer of a chance of getting across the starting line when it comes to getting support from the MPs (when and if they have a chance to vote on it).
And we can be pretty sure what this Northern Ireland-specific arrangement will entail.
Why?
Because this is what the EU had proposed over a year ago (in March 2018). And it is what Theresa May had then rejected in the most forceful terms.
“No British Prime Minister could ever agree to it,” she complained.
Put simply, the backstop meets the need to avoid a hard Irish border after Brexit by avoiding the need for checks and controls on goods moving across that border. Those checks and controls are necessary if the UK and Ireland apply different rules in relation to customs and standards for goods.
The Northern Ireland-specific backstop, as was proposed in the early version of the withdrawal agreement, managed this by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union and in the EU’s single market for goods.
It also has Northern Ireland in the EU’s VAT and excise regime, to keep things as smooth as possible on that front too. No declarations, no tariffs, no quotas, no new checks, no new controls across the Irish border. But the flip side of this is that these things would apply to goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Advertisement
The reason May gave at the time for objecting in such forceful terms to this proposal was that it undermined the ‘constitutional integrity’ of the UK. Given that the security of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK is the very essence of unionism, it is unsurprising that the DUP quickly followed her out in virulent opposition to it.
As May’s team went back to Brussels to continue to work on the withdrawal agreement, the DUP continued to feel unnerved by the very premise of a backstop for Northern Ireland/Ireland.
By the time May and Juncker shook hands on the withdrawal agreement – and its all-UK version of a backstop – the DUP were far from ready for compromise.
The all-UK version of the backstop was clearly intended to reassure unionists. It did this by lifting the possibility of a customs border in the Irish Sea by constructing a shared UK-EU customs territory.
In so doing, it disgusted hardcore Brexiteers in Britain as it contradicted a primary reason for Brexit in the first place. If the UK was in a customs territory with the EU then it was constrained from jetting off to make its own trade deals purely on its own terms.
For many other areas of the backstop, however, things remained as originally conceived: Northern Ireland in the single market for goods (including agriculture) and the EU’s VAT and excise regime, with state aid rules applying.
Circular debate
The degree to which differences between Britain and Northern Ireland expand after Brexit (including in the rather specific areas of toy safety, exhaust emissions or beefquality) was always going to depend on how close London was willing to stay to the EU.
Hence the nervousness of unionists on the very notion of a backstop.
Whilst this all-UK backstop gained broad support from the public, business and civic community in Northern Ireland (all of whom are keen for certainty as the UK leave the EU), many unionists remained firmly unconvinced.
Even though the backstop was stressed to be an insurance policy rather than a landing point, in essence it seemed to prioritise keeping the region close to Ireland over that of its closeness to Britain.
In the win-lose logic of Northern Ireland politics, the whole debate has thus become less about the technical gains and risks of the legal clauses of the Protocol concerned and much more about the sovereignty and integrity of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Related ReadsCast-iron and vital, or an anti-democratic bureaucracy: what is the Irish backstop?
Hence the circular debate.
So why is a Northern Ireland-only backstop once again in vogue?
Partly it is because of time.
Johnson’s plan of forcing an election prior to Brexit day has been kiboshed. He has hung his reputation on getting the UK out of the EU on 31 October.
If this is without a deal, the ensuing economic and political upheaval could well see his premiership be one of the shortest in British history.
If it is with a deal, he needs to go for one that the EU could agree to quickly – and it is more than ready to blow the dust off its original backstop plans.
The bigger question – as always – is whether UK MPs would be prepared to vote for it.
Key to this is whether they agree with (or even care about) the previous Prime Minister’s assertion that a customs border in the Irish Sea is incompatible with the union.
The DUP’s choice would be to own it or to swallow it.
Either way, they may well be wondering how much of a difference their opinion couldpossibly make amid the current maelstrom of Westminster.

https://www.thejournal.ie/budget-2020-prices-brexit-climate-carbon-diesel-cigarettes-fine-gael-4843168-Oct2019/,"PASCHAL DONOHOE TODAY announced Budget 2020 and with measures including a carbon tax increase and a no-deal Brexit fund, it’s already generating plenty of reaction.
But who were the winners and losers from today’s Budget. We’ve tried to break it down.
The government’s green credentials:Ireland may be aself-confessed laggardwhen it comes to climate change, but the government succeeded in wrapping itself in green during the Budget by boasting acarbon tax increase.
It might be be controversial (see the Losers section) but it could be enough to allow Fine Gael to burnish its climate change bona fides at the next election.
Electric car drivers:If you’ve already ditched diesel and petrol, this was a Budget for you. The government promised €3 million for better electric vehicle infrastructure, so we can expect more charging points in the next year.
Advertisement
Parents:There were some positives for parents today. Free GP care for children under eight and free dental care for children under six will be welcome to many, while a €15 increase in the weekly disregard for the One Parent Family payment was also a plus.
Businesses affected by Brexit:“Vulnerable but viable”might sound like a medical diagnosis, but at least businesses and farmers know that the government is paying attention to their worries about Brexit. A€650 million fundavailable for agriculture, enterprise and tourism, as well as €110 million committed to firms affected by Brexit, might offer businesses worried about 31 October some reassurance.
Corporations:Once again, that 12.5% rate of corporation tax isn’t going anywhere.
Green Party:Eamon Ryan might not be back in government yet, but the influence of the Green Party (with its total of two TDs) was written all over this Budget. The Europeanelections in Maymight seem like ancient history, but the fact this Budget was being pitched as the “climate change Budget” is a testament to the influence the party is currently wielding over the direction – if not the pace – of government policy.
Renters:There wasn’t much in the Budget at all today to giverenters reasonfor cheer. Donohoe did announce an extra €2 million to the Residential Tenancies Board to ensure rent-pressure zone measures are properly enforced, but there was nothing much else for people to celebrate.
Imitation is the best form of flattery - the language of the Green Party was all over Budget 2020.Sam Boal / Rollingnews.ieSam Boal / Rollingnews.ie / Rollingnews.ie
Low earners: “This will not be easy for everyone,” Donohoe said as he announced thecarbon tax increase. Sinn Féin, People Before Profit and other critics have long questioned the logic of a carbon tax, which they say will hit the poorest the hardest – a claim that is backed up by theESRI. All eyes will now be on the government to assess whether it follows up with funding to ensure low earners are not adversely affected.
Related ReadsCarbon tax: Petrol and diesel prices to rise from midnight, home heating to rise next MayBudget 2020: Here are the main points you need to knowA pack of 20 cigarettes will now cost €13.50
The fact that there was no increase in the minimum wage will also do little to dispel the notion that low-income earners lost out in this Budget.
Smokers:Will smokers ever be winners in a Budget? It’s certainly unlikely. This year, apack of cigarettesis increased 50 cent.
Climate change activists:There was nothing hugely radical in the Budget today to combat climate change. Extinction Rebellion, who havebeen protestingoutside the Dáil this evening, will have seen little to reassure them that the government is committed to drastic action. Worse, the debate about the carbon tax is threatening to obscure wider discussion around Irish climate policy.
Fianna Fáil is now well-used to being accused by Sinn Féin of propping up the government, so the attacks today are unlikely to faze the party – especially as an election looks inevitable in the next 12 months.
It didn’t get the €5 increase in social welfare it was asking for, but the largest opposition party had little to complain about today – especially when the Budget proved this uncontroversial.

https://www.thejournal.ie/monaghan-lakeland-dairy-4790062-Aug2019/,"POLITICIANS HAVE CRITICISED the announcement that 68 workers at Lakeland Dairies’ Monaghan site will be made redundant.
Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy called the news a “huge blow to the region” and said that the government should intervene to try to save jobs.
Carthy said it was a “significant blow to the Co Monaghan economy that depends so heavily on indigenous employers due to the failure of state agencies to promote this county to outside investors”.
In April, LacPatrick Dairies and Lakeland Dairies announced a merger. In a statement, CEO of Lakeland Dairies Michael Hanley described the decision as “regrettable”.
In Monaghan, 130 people are employed by the company.
“While this development is difficult for everyone concerned, it is necessary to ensure we operate our business in the most efficient manner,” Hanley said.

“It has been the core strategy of Lakeland Dairies to ensure that all sites are run as profitably as possible to ensure we are well-positioned to meet the demand of a competitive global dairy market while protecting the future of our 3,200 farm families,” he added.
Minister for Business, Enterprise & Innovation, Heather Humphreys has expressed her disappointment over the job losses.
“Today’s announcement by Lakeland Dairies of 68 job losses is very disappointing – for the company, for the hard-working employees and their families, and for the local area,” Humphreys said.
Humphreys said she has informed Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty about today’s announcement.
“She has assured me that her Department’s staff are ready to offer every available support to those who are looking to reskill, upskill and seek new employment,” she said.
Humphreys was in Monaghan today announcing40 new jobsfor the area in electrics company MDE Installations.
Cross-border company Lakeland Dairies is the second largest dairy processor in Ireland, processing over 1.85 billion litres of milk every year.

HALF OF SMALL businesses in Ireland have cancelled or postponed investment plans because of Brexit.
AIB’s latest Brexit Sentiment Index found that 50% of SMEs in Ireland had planned to expand or invest in their business and have now either cancelled or postponed those plans as a result of Brexit.
The survey also found that two in five SME business owners have yet to prepare for Britain’s departure from the EU.
Tourism, transport and manufacturing proved to be the most pessimistic sectors with regard to Brexit, according to the research.
Catherine Moroney, head of business banking at AIB, noted that 48% of tourism businesses surveyed reported that Brexit has already had an impact on sales.
Despite this, more than half of reported that they have not yet started planning for Brexit, with 46% of retail businesses reporting the same.
This indicates a lack of certainty when it comes to practical planning for business owners, the report said, which also found that 37% of SMEs aren’t confident they understand what a no-deal Brexit might mean for their business.
The toll of Brexit is already starting to be felt in the Republic according to the report, with 45% of companies reporting a negative impact already.

Business sentiment was at its lowest level since the AIB index began in the third quarter of 2017.

‘Cancelling or postponing’
Catherine Moroney said the new research highlights the impact Brexit is having on the investment and future borrowing plans of SMEs.
“Of the businesses who had planned to invest, we are seeing half of these cancelling or postponing their investment plans due to Brexit and this is translating into businesses also postponing bank borrowing for capital investment,” she said.
“A quarter of businesses now anticipate an increase in working capital requirements as a result of Brexit, a slight increase on the previous wave (of research) but still lower than expected,” she added.
Moroney claimed that “whatever the outcome of Brexit”, there will likely be increased costs relating to customs compliance and delays in the supply chain. A no-deal scenario would bring customs duties.

BELEAGUERED BRITISH PRIME Minister Boris Johnson vowed to continue in his attempts to strike a new Brexit deal with Brussels amid chaotic scenes in the House of Commons in the early hours of this morning.
Rebellious MPs sang, chanted and attempted to block Speaker John Bercow from entering the House of Lords aftervoting to reject Johnson’s second attempt to call a general election last night.
In exceptional scenes as the parliament shut down for five weeks, opposition Labour MPs waved signs reading “silenced”, while one tried to restrain the speaker to prevent him leaving for the House of Lords for the prorogation ceremony.
Opposition MPs jeered and chanted “shame on you” as government MPs left the chamber, while Bercow, in protest, called the suspension “an act of executive fiat”.
Later,Scottish and Welsh MPs began to singas they waited for Bercow to return from the House of Lords where the prorogation ceremony was taking place, passing the time as opposition MPs remained in the House of Commons to protest against the move.
Earlier, Johnson had hit out at opposition MPs for voting against his call for a snap election next month during the final minutes of a late-night debate that preceded his controversial move to prorogue parliament for five weeks.
“While the opposition run from their duty to answer to those who put us here, they cannot hide forever,” he said.
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
It was a final show of defiance in a parliamentary session in which Johnson also lost a vote, which called on the government to publish confidential papers about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit.
The opposition has said it will not allow an early election, which under British law requires a two-thirds majority in parliament in favour, until Johnson has either struck a deal or asked for an extension of Article 50 beyond 31 October.
But Johnson insisted he would not delay Brexit, despite the passing of a bill that could force him to do so if he fails to reach an agreement with the EU.

“This government will not delay Brexit any further,” he insisted.
‘Do or die’
The prorogation – or suspension – of parliament will now take effect for the next five weeks.
Critics of Johnson have hit out at the tactic, arguing that it is a means of driving through the government’s “do or die” Brexit plans, leaving MPs with little time to debate the final Brexit outcome before 31 October deadline.
Parliament is due to return on 14 October, with Johnson’s last chance to reach an agreement at the two-day EU summit starting on 17 October.
Johnson says he wants to revise the deal agreed by his predecessor, Theresa May, which MPs rejected, but says this requires keeping open the option of walking away.
His wafer-thin majority in the Commons vanished last week when he expelled 21 of his own Conservative MPs for voting with Labour on the anti-no deal legislation.

Some commentators have said Johnson may be forced to resign if he does not want to make the delay request. Ministers have also hinted at a potential legal challenge against the law.
The Benn bill – which became law on Monday – would force Johnson to delay Brexit until January or later if he cannot get a deal with Brussels.
The bill’s passage through parliament prompted anger from the government.
But Bercow, accused by eurosceptics of being biased against Brexit, warned the government that it could not now ignore parliament as he announced that he will step down on 31 October.
“We degrade this parliament at our peril,” he warned lawmakers, to a sustained ovation from largely opposition MPs.

The Guardian says parliament has backed Johnson’s withdrawal bill but refused his attempt to “fast-track” legislation.

The Daily Mail says the House of Commons has put the UK at the “mercy of EU” over an extension to the October 31 deadline.

The Daily Telegraph, which typically supports the prime minister, says “Brexit is in purgatory” following last night’s proceedings.

The Sun summarises the situation as “Yeah but no but”.

The Financial Times says Johnson won a “landmark” vote, but was “thwarted” on the timetable for this deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/queens-speech-4850191-Oct2019/,"THE QUEEN’S SPEECH ceremony will begin in all its regal glory at 11.30am today.
Underneath all the red tassles, solid gold ornamental props and splendour, is a very basic function – the start of a British parliamentary session where the government’s agenda and proposed policies are outlined.
For Johnson’s government, we’re expecting 22 proposed new bills that will bring about the change that he has promised since taking office in July, among them plans to make those voting in UK elections produce ID before being given a ballot paper.
Although bills from the previous session were wiped from the agenda during prorogation, which was initiated last Monday, bills being carried over from the 2017-19 Session include theDomestic Abuse Bill 2017-19.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid will hold a budget on implementing these policies on 6 November – but only if there’s a Brexit deal.
About the Queen’s Speech
Traditions surrounding the State Opening of Parliament and the Queen’s Speech can be traced back to the 16th century.

The event is the only regular time when the three parts which make up the UK parliament, the Sovereign, the House of Lords and the House of Commons, come together, and is the most obvious symbol of the royal families’ intertwined relationship with the British legislature.
The ceremony has existed in its current form since 1852, when the Palace of Westminster was rebuilt after the 1834 fire.

What happens during the Queen’s Speech
The ceremonial event will begin with the Queen’s procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster, during which she will be escorted by the army’s Household Cavalry.
The 93-year-old monarch will enter Westminster through the Sovereign’s entrance, located at the base of Victoria Tower, and move to robing room.
While wearing the Imperial State Crown and the Robe of State, she will lead the procession through the Royal Gallery to the House of Lords.
It is here that one of the more unusual traditions begins.
Black Rod, the House of Lords official, will summon the House of Commons to the Lords, but during this process the doors to the Commons chamber will be shut in her face.
Related ReadsThe Queen has approved another suspension of the UK's parliament
It is a practice that dates back to the Civil War and is said to symbolise the Commons’ independence from the monarchy.
Black Rod will have to strike the door three times before it is opened (more on this here). MPs then follow Black Rod and the Commons Speaker to the Lords chamber to listen to the speech.
While sitting on the throne in the House of Lords, the Queen will read the Queen’s Speech, which is written by the Government.
Once the Queen leaves, Parliament will go back to work, with each house meeting separately to begin debating the content of the speech.
When the Queen says: “I pray that the blessing of almighty God may rest upon your counsels” that means the speech is over.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-house-of-lords-election-4796263-Sep2019/,"YESTERDAY WAS AN extraordinary day in British politics.
After Boris Johnson’s first –and memorable– appearance for Prime Minister Questions, the opposition and so-called Tory rebels took control of the parliamentary agenda to ensure laws aiming to avoid a no-deal Brexit are passed.
They managed to get the Benn Bill (so named for Hilary Benn, the man who proposed it) debated, voted on and passed through the House of Commons.
The bill would force the UK government to ask for a three-month extension from the EU if there is no deal by 19 October, which is two days after the next EU summit.
That draft piece of legislation then went to the House of Lords where Boris Johnson’s supporters began a filibustering process – putting down numerous amendments – to delay the passing of the bill.
However, at about 1.30am, a commitment was given to return the bill to the House of Commons by 5pm tomorrow. (Richard Newby, the Liberal Democrats leader in the House of Lords said he was “very pleased he would not be needing his duvet”, while Tory Nicholas True mentioned that he had his toothbrush with him after they voted on the business motion to move more swiftly.)

Once the bill comes back to the House of Commons, MPs will vote on it one final time before it goes to the queen for royal assent.
And that’s where things get interesting again.
Johnson’s bid to call a 15 October general election failed yesterday because his motion didn’t receive two-thirds support in parliament, but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he will back such a proposal once the Benn Bill passes into law and a ban on a no-deal Brexit is on the statute books.
A spokesperson for the prime minister said this morning that Johnson would speak to the public again today and is expected to argue for another election.
“It is clear the only action is to go back to the people and give them the opportunity to decide what they want: Boris to go to Brussels and get a deal, or leave without one on October 31 or Jeremy Corbyn arriving in Brussels with his surrender bill begging for more delay, more dither and accepting whatever terms Brussels imposes over our nation,” Number 10 toldThe Guardian.
Johnson may table another motion looking for a two-thirds majority after the Benn Bill becomes law but he also has other options. Albeit all with their own dangers.
The government could try to get around the Fixed-Term Parliament Act (which is the law that requires the two-thirds majority) by introducing some legislation to supersede it. However, if it does this, the opposition could add amendments, frustrate the process, or simply vote it down if they are joined by more Tory rebels.
Johnson could also call a vote of no confidence in his own government. This would be extreme but potentially useful, and less extreme than the path which would see him resign to bring down the government, forcing the country to the polls.
Even if a general election is called, work on what Brexit will look like will still be required in the coming weeks. However, theFinancial Timesreports that in a note to EU27 diplomats, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier wrote that the discussions with the UK were in a “state of paralysis”.

And, in a day of unusual twists, probably the most bizarre was the resurgence of Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement.
Labour MP Stephen Kinnock put down an amendment which would see the Withdrawal Agreement Bill debated by the House of Commons.
The deal, while based on May’s, was altered following cross-party talks but was never published or voted on. Kinnock wanted to change that, and because of a rare event in the Commons, it will happen.

According toSky News, the MPs who usually count votes in parliament didn’t turn up to count the votes against the amendment. Therefore, it passed by default.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister faces another legal challenge to this prorogation of parliament for five weeks. Former Tory party leader John Major has added his name to that action, initially brought by legal campaigner Gina Miller. It will be heard in the High Court later this morning in London.
Yesterday,a Scottish court ruledthere was nothing illegal about the decision to shut parliament from next week until 14 October.

https://www.thejournal.ie/gatt-24-loophole-boris-johnson-4718203-Jul2019/,"WHAT WILL HAPPEN to trade relations if there’s a no-deal Brexit?
Pro-Brexiteer politicians tend to argue that we can keep trade free (as it is now) after a no-deal Brexit, citing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Article XXIV of the World Trade Organisation treaty, also known as Gatt 24.
“There will be no tariffs, there will be no quotas because what we want to do is to get a standstill in our current arrangements under Gatt 24, or whatever it happens to be, until such a time as we have negotiated” a free trade agreement, Johnson had said in a televised debate on 21 June.
This weekend, Johnson’s views on how Gatt 24 could be used as a work around has been probedby the mediaand his opponent for the leadership, Jeremy Hunt.

Other British politicianshave also suggested that Gatt 24 allows for an interim agreement which – while the UK and EU negotiated a free trade agreement – could maintain the existing arrangements with the EU for 10 years.
This type of solution has also been referred to in the Malthouse Compromise (more on what that was here), which puts forward a “WTO-compliant standstill on trade with no tariffs, no quantitative restrictions and no new barriers” as part of a no-deal “triple safety net”.
But Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, among other trade and economics experts, have dismissed claims that there would be a “standstill” trade arrangement, in the event of a no-deal Brexit in a BBC interview:
The BoE chief added that if the EU didn’t want to apply tariffs to British goods, then it would have to lower tariffs also to the rest of the world.
“We should be clear that no deal means no deal – it means there is a substantial change in the trading relationship with the EU.
The British Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, a supporter of Boris Johnson’s, has hasadvised the government in privatethat it would struggle to keep the UK’s existing tariffs with the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Things have become even clearer this week, as the director of the WTO himself weighed in on what would happen – having remained largely out of the debate up until now.
What is Gatt 24?
There are a number of aspects to the Gatt 24 principle that you need to know in this great Brexit debate of what’s possible in a no-deal scenario, and they are: that it can only be invoked if both the UK and the EU agree to do it; both sides would have to map out a rough idea of what a free trade deal between the two would look like; and even after all that, it only applies to goods.
Let’s start with theagreementbit: the crux of the Gatt 24 rule (written as Article XXIV in the treaty itself, as if it’s not complicated enough) is that in order to use it, you need to have decided to go into this agreement and to indicate that both parties intend to negotiate a Free Trade deal.
Advertisement
A rough sketch of the future trade deal is needed for this – and the EU has said it won’t discuss trade until the £39 billion divorce bill, EU citizens’ rights, and the Northern Ireland border issues are settled – which are contained in May’s Withdrawal Agreement, which has been resoundingly rejected by the UK parliament.
So as it stands, if the UK leaves the EU outside of the Withdrawal Agreement, that means it would revert to the basic trading rules of the WTO – not Gatt 24. This automatically means high tariffs between the UK and the EU.
Another element of the Gatt 24 rule is theMost Favoured Nationprinciple (which is kind of ironically named). Although the UK could choose to continue to apply no tariffs with the EU in the event of a no-deal, under this MFN principle it would mean that it would need to apply the same terms to the rest of the world, too. No favourites.
It would also mean that the EU would be under no obligation to reciprocate the no-tariff approach – and probably wouldn’t if they can avoid it as a way of deterring other countries from leaving the EU.
A group ofpro-Brexit lawyershave argued that this can be worked around if the UK and EU agree that theyintendon negotiating a Free Trade Agreement in future, then they could arrange a temporary free trade area that would last only until the full FTA is agreed, citing Dr Lorand Bartels’one-page draftof such a short-term arrangement.
This would be a work-around to the latter MFN caveat, but would still require the former – for there to be some sort of agreement between the EU and the UK.
At the moment, getting to a point where the EU and UK would both agree that they intend to negotiate a free-trade deal in the future seems far off. The agreement on divorce proceedings – or the UK’s exit from the EU, cutting legal, custom and regulation ties – has ended in the UK’s parliament thrice refusing those conditions.
The EU has said that until those conditions are agreed, they will not discuss future trade deals (the most we have on this is the Future Relationship document, which has also proved divisive for elected British representatives).
What about the WTO?
So far, the WTO have stayed out of the debate on what kind of trading relationship is possible between the EU and the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Former TWO officials have sporadically appeared in news stories, likePeter Ungphakorn, who said in absolute terms: “No deal means there is no agreement with the EU and therefore Gatt Article 24 doesn’t apply.”
He also argued that choosing Gatt 24 isn’t the end of the discussion – you’d still need to decide what kind of temporary FTA you’d want.
But this week, Director General of the WTO Roberto Azevêdo gavean interview to Prospect magazine, in which he made things a bit more clear.
Her said that in a no-deal Brexit scenario, “you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.
Specifically on the topic of Gatt 24, he answered: “Article XXIV of the Gatt is simply the provision of global trade law under which free trade agreements and customs unions are concluded.
The former director of the WTO Pascal Lamyhas been more frankabout claims made by Brexiteers about WTO regulations in a no-deal Brexit.
“Affirmations such as ‘WTO terms would be painless, after all many countries do that’ are one of the many Brexit unicorns flying around,” said Lamy.
“Jumping brutally from trade league one (the internal market without borders) to trade league three (a WTO) would certainly hurt.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexiteers-backstop-4827721-Sep2019/,"AT A BREXIT Party conference in Wales, any mention of the backstop is treated with confusion and dismissal, ending in the same retort:
“The Taoiseach said there wouldn’t be a hard border anyway.”
Although Taoiseach Leo Varadkar recently admitted that there would be checks on or around the Irish border area in the event of a no-deal Brexit, you can see why that would be confusing.
The backstopwas proposed as an insurance policy within the Withdrawal Agreement. It was meant to be used in case a future trade deal meant that the EU and UK customs rules were so different that a hard border on the island of Ireland would have been needed.
This border could vary from cameras to check licence plates and random “pop-up” checks, to custom posts with Revenue officials manning them checking documentation as was the case before.
A police or army force could have been needed to protect those custom posts if they became targets of dissidents as symbols of a divided Ireland – as was the case whenthe border was first erected.
More details of what kind of border we would need aren’t available because we’re unsure of the level of divergence there would be from the UK away from EU rules and regulations – which was one of the strongest arguments the Leave campaign used to argue in favour of Brexit.
Varadkar and the Irish government have been loathe to share details about what a border would look like, as conjuring up a physical infrastructure holds political sensitivities.
One of the results of this seems to bea basic misunderstandingof what the backstop is: instead of it being used as a back-up to avoid a border by temporarily matching Northern Ireland’s rules and regulations with the EU’s, it’s been labelled as an unnecessary tool of the bureaucratic EU.
In the audience of theNewport Wales Brexit Party conference, a couple get into a discussion about Brexit.

The man, whose mother is from Tipperary and who runs his own business says: “That square mile, that Westminster bubble does not run this country. People like me go out, earn the money to pay their wages so they can sit there and treat us like idiots.”
When speaking about Northern Ireland, the woman says: “The Irish have been fighting with the Irish whether they [have the backstop or not]. They’re still at it now, and there’s still a border now. ”
Another member of the Newport audience, who is a health worker, says that although she wants a no-deal Brexit if the UK can’t agree to a deal with the EU, there’s “no simple answer” to the Irish border/backstop question.
“It’s unrealistic. Life doesn’t have simple answers.”
The Brexit Party’s thoughts
Speaking toTheJournal.ie,one of Wales’ four MEPs Nathan Gill said that the backstop “is the only thing that the EU can focus on, it’s the only thing that they think they have as a way of delaying or stopping or changing or whatever it is that they’re trying to do”.
“I genuinely believe it’s a non-story. The Taoiseach has said ‘We’re not building a hard border’…” he begins, before he’s interrupted to be told that the Taoiseach said recently that there would be a hard border.
“Okay, so he’ll be the one to build a border of sorts, the British aren’t going to do it, the EU’s not going to do it. And by checks, what are we talking about? literally, border checks?”
The EU stated in its no-deal plans that there would have to be animal sanitary checks along EU borders with third countries – which is the Northern Ireland-Ireland border.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Junckerconfirmed this last week: “An animal entering Northern Ireland without border control can enter the European Union without any kind of control via the southern part of the Irish island. This cannot happen.”
Nathan Gill continues: “I’d be surprised if they actually do that. I think it’s all rhetoric that they’re giving right now. I think the reality of all of this is, right now Northern Ireland has a different Vat regimes to southern Ireland (sic), there are differences in all kinds of areas, but they just get on with it. And it’s companies that trade with companies, it’s not nations that trade with nations, and never has been.
“Let the people get on with it. Government, get out the way, and all will be well.”
Related ReadsChair of Brexit Party says Varadkar 'hijacked' the backstop issue, and that Irish border trade is 'irrelevant'
When it’s suggested that a border is necessary to enforce the different rules there would be between the UK and the EU post-Brexit, Gill says:
“I mean, that divergence itself would take years to happen.
“If in Ireland, they want to sell their milk – I’m not sure what they have to do to milk to make it sellable into the EU – but make sure they do that. But if they’re going to sell that milk in Belfast, we don’t need to do that. And that’s it. It’s not rocket science.
“And, if I’m going to be selling my products in southern Ireland (sic), then the same thing must happen with Irish farmers and with Ireland if Britain does start to diverge and change our rules and our legislation, then Irish farmers should make sure that they abide by what Westminster says.
When asked about the threat to security in Northern Ireland and along the border, Gill simply says: “If nutjobs want an excuse to do something crazy, then they’ll find an excuse. But if you’re just a normal, sensible human, then you’re not going to do those things.”
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage later told the conference that the Irish border/backstop question was “very difficult to provide an answer for”.
“He’s boxed us in! He’s boxed us in! Mrs May accepted the principle of the backstop, and we’ve been in trouble ever since.”
He also said that there would be no hard border, because Leo Varadkar, the European Union, and the UK all said that there would be no hard border.
When speaking toTheJournal.iein Newport, the Chair of the Brexit Party Richard Tice said that trade across the Northern Irish border was such a “tiny percentage” that it was“irrelevant”in the grand scheme of Brexit.
A Brexit Party spokesperson said of Ireland’s role in Brexit negotiations:
“Ireland is going to regret being used as a stick to beat the UK. That’s what I think.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-boris-no-deal-ireland-timmy-dooley-fianna-fail-leo-varadkar-4745784-Jul2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR and new UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson finally spoke by phoneyesterday, bringing an end to one of the frostiest moments in British-Irish relations in recent years – one that had fuelled concerns that anti-Irish sentiment was rising in London and Whitehall.
In a widely criticised and later-deleted tweet, Fianna Fáil TD Timmy Dooley wrote: “The stand off with our nearest neighbour is as a direct result of Taoiseach Varadkars failure to engage in basic diplomacy over the past 2 years.”
“The Governments [sic] lack of experience and arrogance will hurt Ireland in the coming months,” he added.
Yet former diplomats, ex-civil servants and academics suggest that these fears misunderstand the situation.  Because while Varadkar – and to a lesser extent Tánaiste Simon Coveney – have recently become frequent targets of the British right-wing media, several experts toldTheJournal.iethat it was important not to overstate the extent of anti-Irish sentiment in the UK.
Dr Ben Tonra, a professor of international relations at University College Dublin and an expert on Irish foreign policy, said the British response to Ireland has been based on a view that international relations must fit a “big-country, small-country” dynamic.
The British government, he said, were “wrong-footed” by Ireland’s Brexit strategy. “Part of the British reaction is their being on the back foot in relation to Irish diplomacy,” he said. “They think small countries should behave like small countries.”
Enda versus Leo
Nonetheless, Varadkar has faced a nearly unprecedented level of scrutiny from theBritish mediain recent months – with every comment picked over by the moreright-leaning segments of the press.
Indeed the Fine Gael leaderhas been lambastedas a nationalist intent on causing chaos in the UK – a suggestion often mocked in Ireland, where Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin are seen as the main beneficiaries of nationalist sentiment, whereas Varadkar’s party has typically prided itself in maintaining good diplomatic relations with the British government.
But while an Irish audience often attributes Boris Johnson’s actions to electoral motives, Varadkar too is aware that Brexit will define his premiership. As Tonra notes: “Leo Varadkar’s job is not to be a diplomat” and with an election on the horizon, he “wants the Irish people to know he is fighting their corner”.
The scrutiny on Varadkar has in part led to former taoiseach Enda Kenny being lionised by some in the UK as an unctuous operator more sympathetic to the British position on Brexit.
Even stranger have been some attempts to paint Varadkar and Sinn Féin as close partners in the Brexit process.
Former diplomat Bobby McDonagh, who was Ireland’s ambassador to the UK from 2009 to 2013, has called the idea that Varadkar changed the government’s tack on Brexit “a fiction”.
“It suits the hard Brexiteer narrative,” McDonagh said.  The problem is quite simple, he said, and has little to do with Irish policy at all. It’s a “frustration, on the part of the UK, that life is complex”. Not everyone agrees on this point.
Former diplomat Eamon Delaney argues that “Leo and the government have played a hard ball from the start”. “Enda was playing it more subtly and diplomatically,” he adds.
However, he still acknowledges that “it’s exaggerated that Varadkar is playing to a nationalist agenda”.

Right-wing press
The backdrop to these tensions has been the overt support and outright cheerleading for Boris Johnson, especially from the Daily Telegraph and The Sun. Years before the 2016 referendum, both newspapers led attacks on the EU and the presumed overreach of Brussels into British life. But since the vote, both papers have become key constituencies in the Tory Party’s bid to regain public confidence in Brexit.
The right-wing Spectator magazine cover in October 2018.The SpectatorThe Spectator
In part, this made it nearly inevitable that the Irish government would become targets of criticism – and the recent attacks in the UK press aren’t particularly new.
Former No 10 Brexit spokesperson Matthew O’Toole points to the “asymmetry of knowledge” between Ireland and the UK – a problem that covers everything from Kenny-Varadkar comparisons to an understanding of why Ireland prizes the backstop so highly.
In such a scenario, O’Toole says, it’s much easier to focus on individual politicians or raise the spectre of Sinn Féin.
The right-wing outlets of the UK media began laying the ground years ago for the now more common criticisms of Ireland and Irish policy.
In April 2018, the historian Ruth Dudley Edwardswrote a piecein the Daily Telegraph titled: “The naive Leo Varadkar is being manipulated by the wily Michel Barnier.” As Brexit negotiations have intensified – and the EU have refused to shift on the backstop – Ireland has become a symbol of Brussels’ intransigence.
In October 2018, The Spectator published a story headlined “Divide and rule: How the EU used Ireland to take control of Brexit”.
As it became clear the backstop was going to remain an issue “it was only natural that… there would be a gradual realisation that if we can’t get our way in Europe we’re going to go for the people supporting the backstop”, Guardian journalist and media commentator Roy Greenslade said.
Fast-forward to the summer of 2019 and the changing faces in the EU leadership have left a gap for a new target.
“They can’t suddenly light upon Juncker or Barnier, because the situation is fluid in Brussels,” Greenslade said. In recent months there has been a “clear attempt to create a villain and they’ve alighted upon Varadkar”.
One of the ironies, as people who spoke toTheJournal.ienoted, was that comments like those from Dooley would only empower the government’s critics in the UK.
Yet Greenslade said that it was important not to conflate the attitudes of the British press with that of the general public – there was no danger of these attacks creating anti-Irish sentiment.
“This is nothing like the days of the Troubles, when you think about it was so long ago in the eyes of many people in Britain,” he said.
This was echoed by O’Toole. “There is a lack of engagement with the specifics of Irish history,” he said.
And while the days of anti-Irishness are gone, what remains is a “pervasive ignorance of the complexity and nuance of the Irish government’s position”.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR is to meet UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tomorrow in the north-west of England.
It is understood this will be a private meeting to allow both leaders and their teams to have detailed discussions about the process for securing agreement for a Brexit deal.
While the specifics of the meeting are yet to be publicised, it it believed the Varadkar and Johnson will meet in the Liverpool area at lunchtime.
Over the weekend, the Taoiseach had indicated that he was seeking to arrange a meeting with Johnson this week, stating that time was running out for a deal.
The meeting tomorrow comes as European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said that the EU and UK are “not really in a position to be able to find an agreement at this time.”
Barnier will meet the UK’s Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay tomorrow for a working lunch, and he promised that his team would be available 24/7 in the run-up to the  17/18 October summit.

But he made it clear that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s proposals to replace the backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement Brexit cannot serve as a basis for negotiations.
He said Johnson’s plans for cross-border trade on the island of Ireland would undermine peace and weaken the European single market – and is based on untested technology and as yet unwritten legal arrangements.
“There are no real solutions for SMEs in the British proposals,” Barnier told the European Parliament.

https://www.thejournal.ie/paschal-donohoe-revenue-4824063-Sep2019/,"THE MINISTER FOR Finance has said that another 81 Revenue officers are set to be put in place ahead of the Brexit date of 31 October to fill the planned 600 posts needed to cope with Britain’s exit from the EU.
In September 2018, the government approved the phased recruitment of an additional 600 Revenue staff to cope with the demands that Brexit will put on its activities.
In Budget 2019, Revenue was provided with an additional €10 million pay provision, for 270 of the additional 600 staff to be recruited during 2019.
Following a government decision in December 2018, it was agreed to accelerate Revenue’s recruitment programme in preparation for Brexit.
In July, the minister said that the majority of those hired so far had been deployed to import and export trade facilitation activities, and policy and operational roles.
However, the extra 600 staff for Revenue was put in place on the basis of the “central case” scenario where the UK leaves the EU with a withdrawal agreement that includes a transition period where things stay the same until the end of 2020.

Donohoe stated: “Revenue will continue to adjust its recruitment and training plans in response to business needs, including Brexit-related developments.”
As of July, 281 staff have been assigned to Dublin in preparation for Brexit, including 213 in 2019.
In addition, 119 have been assigned in Munster including 104 this year with a further 40 assigned in Leinster, excluding Dublin and Louth.
Given the political chaos in Britain at present, it remains possible for the UK to leave without a deal on 31 October.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said last weekend that there will be border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
“We have to make the sure the interests of the European Union and of the internal market will be preserved,” he said. “An animal entering Northern Ireland without border control can enter the European Union without any kind of control via the southern part of the Irish island. This cannot happen. We have to preserve the health and safety of our citizens.”
The minister said he expects the remaining Revenue staff to be in place in time for 31 October, whatever form Brexit may take.
In response to a parliamentary question last week, Donohoe said: “I am advised by Revenue that 519 of these staff have already been  appointed and trained, with the remaining staff to be in place and trained by 31 October 2019.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-eu-divorce-bill-johnson-4782607-Aug2019/,"THE UK MUST pay its Brexit divorce bill even if it crashes out without a deal, the EU has warned – adding that future ties will be threatened if London fails to honour its commitments.
The stern response comes a day afterBoris Johnson again saidthat in the event of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, the UK would be free from financial obligations to the EU.
With the clock ticking and fears of no deal growing, Johnson and European Council President Donald Tusk clashed at the G7 in France on Saturday, with the British leader insisting the current divorce deal must be changed.
Asked if the EU would take Britain to court to recover the money, a spokeswoman for the European Commission instead stressed that a future trade deal between Britain and the remaining 27 states could be under threat unless London paid up.
“As we have said many times before, all commitments that were taken by the 28 member states should be honoured, and this is also and especially true in a no deal scenario, where the United Kingdom would be expected to honour all commitments made during EU membership,” commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told reporters.
Jean-Claude Piris, who served as director of the EU Council’s legal services for more than two decades, tweeted: “If the U.K. refuses to pay its debts to the EU, then the EU will not accept to negotiate a trade agreement with the U.K.”

Johnson has repeatedly said that if Britain leaves without a deal it will not have to pay the €43 billion divorce bill agreed by his predecessor Theresa May.
He repeated the claim again on Sunday, telling ITV that the money would be “no longer, strictly speaking, owed” and his government would be left with “very substantial sums” to spend.
Downing Street has reportedly refused to say how much the UK would be prepared to pay, though a report in the London Times today quoted a figure of seven billion pounds.

The tough line from Brussels echoes comments by a French official last week who warned London against thinking “there’s not a deal, so I won’t pay”, saying “there’s no magic wand that makes this bill disappear.”
Johnson is adamant the withdrawal agreement struck by May – rejected by parliament three times – is dead in the water and changes must be made, particularly to the backstop, if a deal is to be agreed and a no-deal exit avoided.
Speaking to reporters in Clonmel today, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said news of the meeting between Johnson and Tusk was welcome. While no-one knew what had been discussed behind closed doors, there were no indications of any big breakthroughs, Coveney said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/supreme-court-high-court-gina-miller-prorogue-brexit-boris-4798164-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|6 Sep 2019
THE HIGH COURT in London has ruled that Boris Johnson’s plan to prorogue parliament is not illegal.
The case was brought by Gina Miller,  who won a case in 2017 which saw judges determine that parliament had to have a vote on triggering Article 50 – the mechanism to allow a country to leave the EU.
The case, one of three taken against the UK prime minister’s decision, will be appealed to the Supreme Court.
It is expected that the case will be heard on 17 September.
Miler’s barrister, Lord Pannick QC, argued yesterday that prorogration breached parliamentary sovereignty.

The announcement that parliament would be prorogued from 9 September until 14 October triggered a storm of political anger, sparking protests, legal challenges and claims that Johnson was undermining British democracy.
Johnson and his government have denied the accusation that the decision is an attempt to stifle debate on Brexit.
Today’s decision will come as good news to Boris Johnson, who has suffered a week of defeats and embarrassments after losinghis first four votesin the House of Commons and his brotherJo Johnson resigning from government.

“We will not give up our fight for democracy,” Miller said today following the decision. “As our politics becomes ever more chaotic, we feel it is absolutely vital that our parliament should be sitting.”
“To give up now would be a dereliction of our responsibility,” she said.
Scotland
A decision is also expected from Scotland next week, where Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry brought a case challenging prorogation to the Court of Session.
Earlier this week, the Outer House of Scotland’s highest civil courtrejected the petition, which is backed by 75 UK parliamentarians and campaigner Jolyon Maugham of the Good Law Project.

Lord Doherty rejected the claim that prorogation was illegal and said that the decision was not a matter for the courts to rule on.
Yesterday’s hearing in the Inner House saw lawyer Aidan O’Neill QC repeat the charges that prorogration undermined the British parliament and posed a threat to the rule of law.
The hearing yesterday had an impact beyond the courtroom in Edinburgh. Partially redacted government documents released as part of the caseappear to show thatJohnson had agreed to prorogation as early as 15 August.
Proceedings in the Court of Session will began again this morning.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-economy-2-4771999-Aug2019/,"IRELAND’S ECONOMY IS set to grow by 4% this year and 2.7% next year, but a no deal Brexit could impact that, according to an Irish business lobby group.
Ibec’s Q3 Quarterly Economic Outlook states that Irish households have benefitted from strong growth over the past few years, which has increased incomes.
It states that economic growth – measured in Gross domestic product (GDP) – is slowing down, with the economy forecast to grow by 2.7% next year.
These forecasts are based on the assumption that a deal on Brexit is reached, and Britain doesn’t go crashing out of Europe on 31 October.

Ibec states in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there will be significant impacts from continued depreciation in the value of sterling, cancelled investment, falling consumer confidence, rising costs and significant trade disruption.
It states that the economy could still grow, but that growth could more than half. It has called for measures in October’s budget to include state supports for companies.
“Every indicator of the Irish economy tells the same story. The economy is continuing to grow rapidly through a period of great uncertainty. This growth is also clearly benefitting households,” said Gerard Brady, chief economist with Ibec.
Brady said that it wasn’t all good news, however.
“2018 was the first year where the value of Irish indigenous exports fell since 2011. This trend has been reversed in the early months of 2019 driven by continued increases in production in both the alcohol and dairy sectors,” he said.
“Both sectors will face challenges over the coming year due to US tariffs and Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bercow-pressure-to-allow-meaningful-vote-on-brexit-deal-4860329-Oct2019/,"HOUSE OF COMMONS speaker John Bercow is facing demands from the Government to allow MPs to have a “meaningful vote” on Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal as the Prime Minister fights to fend off new threats to his plans.
All eyes are on the Commons speaker as he decides whether to allow the vote to take place on Monday amid concerns that he may reject it because of parliamentary rules.
Johnson is also facing a court challenge over his extension request and Labour attempts to secure a customs union and a second referendum.
In his latest Commons defeat, Johnson abandoned plans for a meaningful vote on Saturday when MPs backed a move forcing him to ask Brussels for a further delay.
But because the deal had been debated, there are concerns that Bercow could block a vote coming back so soon because of rules over the same matter being discussed twice.
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak denied that trying to bring the deal back for a vote was a bid to portray as Parliament being obstructive.
“It was an observation on the deal happening and I think what people need is a substantive vote,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

“I think people are crying out to see that and they would find it odd if, because of some technical procedural device, we weren’t able to have that vote.”
If the speaker does block the move, focus will switch to the Government bringing its Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) before MPs on Monday, with a vote on its second reading on Tuesday.
The WAB is the legally-binding treaty that must be passed for the UK to leave the EU, while the government must also win a meaningful vote.
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay called on MPs to “respect the referendum” by backing the Bill, warning them that “this is the chance to leave the EU with a deal on October 31.”
Ministers insist they could have sufficient support among MPs to get it passed so the UK can depart by the current October 31 deadline.
But, with no Commons majority, Johnson faces a major battle to achieve his cast-iron pledge.
Labour has denied it is trying to scupper the the Prime Minister’s agreement by planning to amend it to secure a customs union and a second referendum as the legislation passes through Parliament.
Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told the Today programme: “We are not attempting to wreck it, we are attempting to safeguard the British economy, safeguard jobs and safeguard public services.
“We believe that the responsible way in which to leave the European Union is in a customs union arrangement and that, in turn, should be put to the British people so they can have a say on this.”
Related ReadsTaoiseach says risk of no-deal Brexit is 'relatively low' but preparations will continue
Meanwhile, judges are set to decide whether the unsigned letter sent by the Prime Minister asking for a Brexit extension from the EU complied with the Benn Act, or if he is in contempt of court.
Johnson was forced to send the letter under the law passed by MPs trying to fend off a no-deal Brexit because MPs did not support his deal by the Saturday deadline.
But he signed a second letter and said a delay would be a mistake and judges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh are to resume a hearing on Monday.
The letters were sent after former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin handed Johnson an embarrassing defeat in the Commons.
Letwin, who was among the rebels exiled by Johnson over their attempts to stop a no-deal, successfully tabled an amendment which effectively forced Johnson to ask for a delay.
As parliament demanded in the Benn Act, Johnson wrote to European Council president Donald Tusk requesting an extension to the end of January.
Johnson did not sign the letter, and sent a second communication insisting that a delay would be “deeply corrosive” for the UK and the EU.
Labour accused Johnson of behaving like a “spoiled brat”.

Earlier, UK prime minister Boris Johnson asked the queen to suspend parliament from the second week in September until 14 October, less than two weeks before the UK is set to leave the European Union.
The Queen approved this request, and the move by Johnson has sparked outrage and condemnation from opposition MPs.
“I have protested in the strongest possible terms on behalf of my party and all the other opposition parties that are going to join in with this in saying that suspending parliament is not acceptable, It’s not on,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said.
Following the move, thousands of people have taken to the streets of London and other cities to protest.
“If you shut down our parliament, we shut down the streets,” protesters chanted in Parliament Square in London.

“There will be ample time on both sides of that crucial 17 October [EU] summit, ample time in parliament for MPs to debate the EU, to debate Brexit and all the other issues; ample time,” Johnson said.
Here at home, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has said a request from Green Party leader Eamon Ryan to recall the Dáil from its summer break will be “seriously considered”.
Speaking to RTÉ’s News at OneDonohoe said his focus is getting Ireland ready for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, reiterating that it is a growing, material risk.
When asked if today’s developments in the UK will mean changes to the Irish backstop, the minister was clear, replying: “No.”

THE DUP HAS criticised the Irish government for “unhelpful” language when speaking about Brexit and Northern ireland, accusing the Tánaiste of being “downright provocative and disrespectful”.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney have both given statements on the current Brexit state of play following the appointment of Boris Johnson as the British Prime Minister.
Coveney said that Johnson’s comments on Brexit have been“unhelpful”, Varadkar said today that if Johnson wants a deal, he will have to go back on some of the comments he’s made this week, particularly in relation to the backstop.
This evening, MP for North Antrim Ian Paisley Junior said that the Irish government should “dial down the megaphone diplomacy”.
“It is high time Simon Coveney showed some respect for the constitutional situation. If he wants to make inflammatory statements, he should do so in his own country and be fully aware of the damage he is doing.”

Reconsidering the union

Speaking today at MacGill’s Summer School in the Glenties, Co Donegal, Leo Varadkar said that he doesn’t know whether there will be a United Ireland in his lifetime, but has said that he thinks that those in Northern Ireland will reconsider their role in the union.
“I honestly don’t know – I do think that more and more people in Northern Ireland, certainly in the event of a no deal, will come to question the union.
He said that having a Green Paper or a form on Irish unity would be “provocative” in the current climate, and said that the Irish government was simply “trying to achieve the status quo” and not, as has been accused of them, “exploiting Brexit”.
When asked what he will say to the new British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Varadkar said that he would “congratulate him, really get a measure of the man, and hear about his plans” for Brexit. He also said that:
Johnson has repeated claims he made before becoming Prime Minister that the backstop needs to be removed from the withdrawal agreement, or replaced with technological solutions which he hasn’t specified yet.
Speaking about the Confidence and Supply agreement between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, Varadkar said “politics doesn’t always work, but I think it’s a good example of how politics has given Ireland stability”. He added:

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-talks-2-4848499-Oct2019/,"UK AND EU officials will continue Brexit talks over the weekend amid rising speculation a deal is on the cards which could break the deadlock over the Irish border.
The EU’s chief negotiatorMichel Barnier gave the green light yesterdayfor intensive discussions between officials to start.
It followed an apparent breakthrough in talks on Thursday between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at a country house retreat on the Wirral.
Their discussionsappeared to unblock the negotiationswhich had seemed to have been running into the ground following the publication of Boris Johnson’s Brexit blueprint.
Johnson cautioned it was not a “done deal” and there was still “a way to go” if they were to get an agreement which would enable Britain to leave on 31 October, as he has promised.
Meanwhile, Johnson will challenge MPs to back any deal he has secured from Brussels when parliament sits on a weekend next Saturday for the first time in almost four decades, The Times has reported.
He is preparing to hold a vote on his deal on the “Super Saturday” parliament sitting as he seeks MPs to either endorse his approach or force through a Brexit delay, the paper says.

Barnier is due to brief EU ambassadors and MEPs on Monday on progress – but time is rapidly running out if they are to get an agreement in place in time for EU leaders to sign off on it at next week’s Brussels summit.
With UK officials remaining tight-lipped, there has been intense speculation over what was said at the talks at Thornton Manor which enabled the process to move forward.
The discussions focused heavily on the issues of the customs arrangements and the proposed “consent” mechanism for the Northern Ireland Assembly.
The EU strongly objected to a proposal in Johnson’s Brexit blueprint for Northern Ireland to leave the customs union together with the rest of the UK – meaning the return of customs controls on the island of Ireland.
Brussels is also concerned that a proposal in the British plan for Northern Ireland to remain tied to EU single market rules for trade in goods could be vetoed before it had even got off the ground by the DUP.
There has been speculation that Johnson could now try to revive a compromise proposal first put forward by Theresa May that would see Northern Ireland remain politically in a customs union with the EU, but that it would be administered by the UK.
Speaking during a school visit yesterday, Johnson was adamant he would not accept any arrangement which damaged the ability of “the whole of the United Kingdom” to take full advantage of Brexit, including any new trade deals struck with countries around the world.
Meanwhile the DUP, whose support is likely to be crucial if Mr Johnson is to get a deal through parliament, warned they would only back measures that were in the “long-term economic and constitutional interests “ of Northern Ireland.
DUP leaderArlene Foster said: “In order to secure a sensible deal for everyone it is important that the European Union understand that to maximise the prospects of agreement there will need to be a clear acceptance that the economic and constitutional integrity of the whole of the United Kingdom will have to be respected as we leave.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/jeremy-corbyn-brexit-4783473-Aug2019/,"LAST UPDATE|27 Aug 2019
A CROSS-PARTY MEETING of British MPs have agreed to work together to force through legislation to prevent a no-deal departure from the EU.
In a display of unity, leaders and MPs from a range of parties – bar the Conservatives – came together to agree a strategy against a no-deal Brexit and to form an alternative parliament if UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson does try and prorogue parliament.
During a meeting at Church House – where MPs met during WWII – shadow chancellor John McDonnell issued a warning to Johnson of the dangers of trying to pursue a no-deal Brexit against the will of parliament.
“Prime ministers come and prime ministers go but I don’t think we have seen a prime minister like this who has had the potential to threaten the very nature of our democracy,” he said.
Caroline Lucas of the Green Party and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, as well as former Tory Anna Soubry, joined McDonnell to agree on a plan for the coming weeks as fears grow over Johnson’s hardline approach to Brexit.
In an interview with the BBC this evening, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said an agreement had been reached to try to use legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit, as opposed to immediately triggering a no-confidence vote in Johnson.
“The motion of no confidence will be put, by me, at an appropriate time. But obviously not the first item next Tuesday because I believe it is important that we get on with a legislative process which prevents the prime minister acting in defiance of the will of parliament,” Corbyn said.

We must find common ground and a practical way to stop this disastrous No Deal Brexit.pic.twitter.com/0O2KnoXSdm
Earlier today, Corbyn had “productive and detailed” meetings with the opposition parties about how they would work together to block a no-deal Brexit.
The Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Independent Group for Change released a joint-statement this afternoon expressing concern over UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s threats to use “anti-democratic means” to force through a no-deal.
Corbyn had planned to call a no-confidence vote in Johnson as soon as possible and would be ready to lead a caretaker government to delay Brexit if he wins that vote.
But those plans have been put to one side as he instead prioritises legislation that would block a no-deal Brexit. The SNP’s Ian Blackford said this evening that the UK faces an “enormous challenge”.
Blackford said that the parties had “laid our differences at the door, because we recognise the scale of the challenge that collectively we face. And woe betide anyone who doesn’t work in a collective fashion”.
Ahead of the cross-party talks, Corbyn warned about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.
Corbynwrote in the Independentthat Prime Minister Boris Johnson was “cosying up to” US President Donald Trump “because a No Deal Brexit is really a Trump Deal Brexit”.
The UK parliament is not due to resume until next week but anti-Brexit politicians have been discussing plans ever since Johnson came to power last month vowing to take Britain out of the EU on 31 October deal or no deal.
Johnson has said he is hoping for a deal with EU leaders.
Today, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker told Johnson in a phone call that the UK alone will be to blame for a no-deal Brexit.
Related ReadsJohnson short on detail on Brexit plans as diplomatic tour comes to an end at G7Explainer: The British press has seized on Merkel's '30 days' remark - but what did she mean by it?
“He recalled that while the EU is fully prepared for a ‘no-deal’ scenario, it will do everything it can to avoid such a situation,” the commission said in a statement outlining the call.
“A ‘no-deal’ scenario will only ever be the UK’s decision, not the EU’s.”
The political impasse has raised the chances of a general election and politicians of all stripes are preparing.
The Brexit Party, which came first in European elections earlier this year and which advocates a no-deal Brexit, is presenting its candidates at a launch event later.
The UK voted to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum but has been forced to delay its exit twice after parliament opposed a deal struck with Brussels under Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May.
“Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will do anything to try and block delivering the change that British people voted for in the referendum,” the Conservatives said in a statement.
“Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives can provide the leadership the UK needs to deliver Brexit by 31 October, whatever the circumstances,” the statement said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/prime-minister-boris-johnson-speech-4738736-Jul2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has given his first speech to the public, standing outside 10 Downing Street flanked by his new team.
In a fiery speech delivered to the hum of far-off protesters’ bellows, Johnson pledged to leave the European Union by the Brexit deadline of 31 October.
“I have every confidence that in 99 days time, we will have cracked it. But do you know what, we’re not going to wait 99 days because the British people have had enough of waiting.”
Both the backstop and Ireland got a mention in his first speech as premier:

Johnson also referred to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as “the awesome foursome,” represented by the “red white and blue flag which is so much more than the sum of its parts”.
The new Conservative Party leader also made a raft of domestic policy announcements in a nearly 12-minute address.
“I will take personal responsibility for the change I want to see,” he said, promising tax reforms, better access to to GPs, and support for businesses.
“If there is one thing that has really sapped the confidence of business, it is not the decisions we have taken – it is our refusal to take decisions.
He said that the UK would have the “lubrication” of the £39 billion that the UK must pay as part of Theresa May’s divorce bill, which the EU has argued is a legal requirement.
“To those who say we cannot be ready, I say Do not underestimate this country… because we know the enormous strengths of this country.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-court-case-4788824-Aug2019/,"A NO-DEAL Brexit will plunge Northern Ireland into turmoil, the High Court in Belfast heard today.
Counsel for victims campaigner Raymond McCord claimed the region would suffer worst from the UK quitting the EU without an agreement as he advanced attempts to stop Boris Johnson suspending parliament.
He is seeking an urgent injunction aimed at forcing the British prime minister to reverse plans to prorogue the House of Commons ahead of the 31 October leave date.
His barrister, Ronan Lavery QC, argued:
“In many ways there are stronger reasons in Northern Ireland why interim relief is applicable, because of the obvious turmoil that will be created here if there’s a no-deal Brexit.”
With the legal action adjourned to next week, McCord confirmed he still intends to press for an interim order to block the planned parliamentary shutdown.
The Belfast man, whose son Raymond Jr was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997, is mounting a wider action against any withdrawal from the EU without an agreement.

Good Friday Agreement
He claims a departure on those terms would breach the Good Friday Agreement and threaten the Northern Ireland peace process.
Outside court McCord explained why he believes Johnson’s prorogation move must be overturned.
“It’s undemocratic. We have got a prime minister who wants to force Brexit through with no deal,” he claimed.
With Johnson pledging that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October “do or die”, he is facing three court challenges in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Although McCord’s case is listed for full hearing next month, he took urgent legal steps after plans to close parliament for up to five weeks were announced.
His lawyers contend that the use of prorogation is unconstitutional.
At today’s hearing Lavery told the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan:
Tony McGleenan QC, representing the government and prime minister, pointed out that a similar attempt to secure an injunction was refused in the Scottish case.
Opposing the bid for an urgent hearing ahead of the full judicial review application, he said:
Adjourning proceedings until next week, Sir Declan imposed a deadline for lodging further papers.

UK Prime MInister Boris Johnson in the House of Commons on Saturday.parliament.ukparliament.uk
THERE WAS TO be no meaningful vote on Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal today.
That much we know afterHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow ruledtoday that parliament already had its say on the deal over the weekend in theform of the Letwin Amendment.
Bercow said today that circumstances had not changed enough to require another vote and therefore thwarted the efforts of Johnson’s government to have a vote on the deal.
The Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) waspublishedin full this evening.
UK.govUK.gov
So what happens now?
Well, what we’re going to see is many more Commons votes that will effectively determine how Brexit will play out in the coming weeks and possibly months.
The Letwin Amendment stated that a vote on the deal cannot pass until all associated Brexit-related legislation is also passed.
We now know that it is the UK government’s plan to have that legislation passed this week in the form of the WAB.
Advertisement
The WAB is effectively the bill which gives legal effect to the provisions contained in the treaty agreed between Johnson’s government and the EU.
Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg MP confirmed this afternoon that the government would publish the WAB tonight and will aim to have debate completed by Thursday.
The very optimistic hope for the government is that it can get the bill through the Commons by Friday and have it passed by the House of Lords over the weekend.
This could potentially allow Johnson achieve his stated goal of leaving the EU on 31 October.
But the passage of the WAB through the House of Commons is likely to present major headaches for Johnson’s government and could even kill the deal altogether.
Amendments
MPs opposed to Johnson’s plans will seek to table number of amendments to the bill which could radically alter the course of Brexit.
One such amendment being mooted is one which states that there should be a confirmatory referendum on any deal before Brexit takes place. Another amendment could potentially state that the UK should remain inside the EU’s customs union.
That is radically different to the actual deal Johnson negotiated, so should that amendment be passed it could kill any chance of an agreed Brexit in the short-term.
The numbers in favour of either amendment are only likely to be clear once the votes take place, but it is believed that the customs union amendment has a better chance of being approved.
But even aside from the problems WAB will cause the UK government, there are even questions about whether the timeline being proposed is legal.
AsThe Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn points out, treaties laid before the Commons are required to have 21 days before they can be ratified.

There is a clause within the WAB which exempts it from this requirement but the House of Lords is thought to be especially worried about circumventing this.
And just to give some extra context on the superfast timeline the WAB is supposed to achieve, the Maastricht Treaty took 46 days to pass the House of Commons while WAB is being expected to do it in eight.

Speaking of the EU…
If Brexit is indeed to happen by 31 October, the European Parliament would also need to ratify the deal and it’s unclear how soon MEPs will do that.
The European Parliament’s chief Brexit official Guy Verhofstadt said last week that MEPs will only start their work once the Commons has passed a fully-binding Brexit deal.
This evening, he said the Brexit Steering Group had met to discuss the latest developments in the UK:
Guy Verhofstadt / TwitterGuy Verhofstadt / Twitter/ Twitter
Fitting the EU’s approval into the complicated timeline is just another hurdle that Johnson’s government must clear if it has any chance of making Brexit a reality by 31 October.
Should all this not happen and it become clear that the deal will not be passing parliament, it would leave the EU free to give its answer on the request for another extension. Even thoughJohnson says he doesn’t want one, of course.
For the UK prime minister though, an extension could give him the window and opportunity he needs toactually hold that election he desires.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-economic-opportunity-4742716-Jul2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said Brexit was a “massive economic opportunity” but had been treated under his predecessor Theresa May as “an impending adverse weather event”.
In a speech in Manchester where he pledged new investment in Leave-voting areas, Johnson promised to step up negotiations on post-Brexit trade deals and set up free ports to boost the economy.
“When people voted to leave the European Union, they were not just voting against Brussels, they were voting against London too,” he said.
Johnson promised to give more powers to local communities, as well as boost broadband and transport infrastructure in a speech focused on domestic issues.
“Taking back control doesn’t just apply to Westminster regaining sovereignty from the EU, it means our cities and counties and towns becoming more self governing,” he said.
When asked about the prospect of Brexit negotiations, Johnson said he was willing to engage with EU partners but only if the backstop clause was removed from the current divorce agreement struck by May.
The backstop seeks to ensure a free-flowing post-Brexit border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in all eventualities.
“The approach of the UK government is not going to be disengaged or aloof or waiting for them to come to us, we are going to try to solve this problem,” he said.
“We can’t do it as long as that anti-democratic backstop, that backstop that seeks to divide our country, divide the UK, remains in place. We need to get it out and then we can make progress.”
Irish government
Over the past few days, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney have both given statements on the current Brexit state of play following the appointment of Johnson as the British Prime Minister.
Coveney said that Johnson’s comments on Brexit have been“unhelpful”.
“The statements of the British Prime Minister yesterday in the House of Commons were very unhelpful to this process,” Coveney told reporters on Friday.
“He seems to have made a deliberate decision to set Britain on a collision course with the European Union and with Ireland in relation to the Brexit negotiations, and I think only he can answer the question as to why he is doing that.”
DUP MP Ian Paisley Junior has criticised Coveney for his comments.
Yesterday evening, Paisley Junior said that the Irish government should “dial down the megaphone diplomacy”.

“The Irish government is entirely entitled to speak its mind. However, for the Irish Foreign Minister to parade around Parliament Buildings in Stormont as if it is his seat of government is downright provocative and disrespectful,” Paisley Junior said.
“It is high time Simon Coveney showed some respect for the constitutional situation. If he wants to make inflammatory statements, he should do so in his own country and be fully aware of the damage he is doing.”
Varadkar said yesterday that if Johnson wants a deal, he will have to go back on some of the comments he’s made this week, particularly in relation to the backstop.
Speaking at MacGill’s Summer School in the Glenties, Co Donegal, Leo Varadkar said that he doesn’t know whether there will be a United Ireland in his lifetime, but has said that he thinks that those in Northern Ireland will reconsider their role in the union.
“I honestly don’t know – I do think that more and more people in Northern Ireland, certainly in the event of a no deal, will come to question the union,” Varadkar said.
‘Absolutely’ rules out election
Meanwhile, Johnson has also tried to dampen speculation he could call an early election.
Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the EU by the latest deadline of 31 October – deal or no deal.
But he has focused on domestic priorities in his first few days in office, including a pledge yesterday to reverse drastic cuts to the police force made under May.
Commentators have speculated that he could be preparing to call a general election, hoping to regain the Conservative majority that May lost at the polls in 2017.
Johnson yesterday “absolutely” ruled out initiating such a poll before Britain leaves the bloc.
“The British people voted in 2015, in 2016, in 2017,” he said during a visit to the central English city of Birmingham.
“What they want us to do is deliver on their mandate, come out of the EU on October 31.
However, Britons could be headed to the polls if MPs bring down Johnson’s new government in a no confidence vote in order to try and prevent a no-deal Brexit from happening.
Britain voted 52% in favour of leaving the EU in a shock 2016 referendum .
Johnson said today’s speech intended to “set out his vision to rebalance power, growth and productivity across the UK”.
May also came to power promising to fight Britain’s “burning injustices”. However, her domestic agenda was overwhelmed by Brexit negotiations and her failed attempts to persuade parliament to vote in favour of her exit deal.

THERE WERE CRIES of “shame” from the opposition benches in the House of Commons today as the Brexit Secretary invoked the memory of Mo Mowlam as he argued in support of the revised Brexit deal.

“Today is the time for this House to come together and move forward. Someone who previously did that… was the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam,” Stephen Barclay said as he began his address this morning.
A shout of “how dare you” could be heard from the Labour benches.
Speaker John Bercow had to intervene to ask for calm. Barclay went on to remark that Mowlam had called her autobiography Momentum and to tell MPs that the UK needed the same momentum today, as he brought forward the main motion.
Mowlam, who died in 2005, was best known for her time as Northern Ireland secretary under Tony Blair in the late 1990s and for her work building community links around the time of the Good Friday Agreement.
She was extremely popular in the wider Labour party.

“Deeply offensive of the Brexit Sec to use the memory of Mo Mowlem (sic) in the chamber to urge us to vote to leave the EU,” Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberrywrote on Twitter.
“Mo was a passionate European who believed it was in all our interests to stick together. She would never have stopped fighting for us to #Remain.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/arlene-foster-brexit-backstop-4830318-Sep2019/,"DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster has said her party would “look at” a time-limited backstop – as she insisted there remains a chance of reaching a deal before 31 October.
The proposal would put a deadline on the backstop arrangement required by the European Union to avoid a hard border in Ireland – something that has previously been rejected by the Irish government.
Foster made the comments while speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester yesterday.
“In terms of the time-limited backstop, can I remind you what Leo Varadkar thinks of the time-limited backstop – he says it is not a backstop at all. And so in terms of the time-limited backstop we have said in the past it is something we would look at.
“I don’t think it is something that Leo Varadkar would look at, but certainly if a time-limited backstop was on offer it is something that we would look at, but I don’t believe it is at this present moment in time,” Foster said.
She described the backstop proposal as “anti-democratic”, but said she believed a “way forward” existed – claiming it was possible to find a deal “even at this late stage”.
“I firmly believe that there is a way forward,” Foster said, adding that if the EU and the Irish government “care about protecting” the Good Friday Agreement “they need to acknowledge that the backstop will not do it for Northern Ireland”.
Foster, whose party props up Boris Johnson’s minority government, later added: “I think even at this late stage we can find a deal that is acceptable to the House of Commons and is acceptable to Europe.”
Customs arrangements
However, Foster remained adamant that Northern Ireland had to leave the EU “on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom” in relation to customs arrangements.

“We cannot have internal customs borders within the United Kingdom … it has constitutional implications as well as economic implications.
“I’m not saying the north-south trade is not important – it is of course important – but our east-west trade is much more important,” Foster said.
‘Time is running out’
Speaking on Friday after a meeting with chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels, Tánaiste Simon Coveney warned that “time is running out” to reach a Brexit deal.
“There are still significant gaps between both sides,” Coveney said.
“The clear message that I would have got from Michel Barnier today is that his team and he himself are available 24/7 to negotiate towards trying to get a deal done.
“Time is running out. We need to move this process on but, really, the onus is on the British Prime Minister and his team to allow that to happen by putting serious proposals on the table that the EU can negotiate around to try and find a way of getting a deal done here.”
On 20 September, the UK Brexit minister Stephen Barclay met with Barnier and submitted three papers with ideas on replacing the backstop.
“There is significant work still to do but there are serious discussions that are taking place,” Barclay said after those talks. However, the Irish government and the EU have been less optimistic about progress towards securing a deal.
Coveney on Friday repeated that any solution put forward by the UK government must “must avoid a hard border, fully protect the Good Friday Agreement and north-south cooperation, and preserve the all-island economy”.
“To date there is nothing else on the table that achieves the same outcome as the backstop,” he added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/customs-checks-border-brexit-simon-coveney-4806090-Sep2019/,"TANAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said any customs checks imposed in a no-deal scenario will not be permanent.
Speaking at the Fine Gael’s annual think-in in Cork this morning, Coveney said the Irish government now needs “to level with people” in terms of what a no-deal Brexit actually means.
“We shouldn’t be sugar-coating anything,” he said, outlining to reporters that checks will return to Ireland, though they will not be along the border.
“We don’t regard those checks that may be needed in a no-deal as a permanent arrangement – not by a long shot”.
He said any new checks imposed will be temporary until a better trade deal is arrived at, adding that any such deal requires a commitment on the Irish border issue.
The Irish government has a dual responsibility to both the peace process and the EU Single Market.
Protect the EU Single Market
In a no-deal scenario, the Tánaiste said the Irish government would be forced to protect Ireland’s place in the EU Single Market “by having some checking system somewhere – away from the border that can reassure the rest of the EU that Ireland’s place in the Single Market is protected and the integrity of the market that we all enjoy will be protected too and that is important for Irish consumers too”.
Any checks will be “a temporary arrangement to protect our place in the Single Market while we continue to negotiate for the kind of arrangement on the Irish border that the British government has committed to in the past in writing”, he said.
He added that a timeline for how long the temporary checks will be operational will have to be agreed with the EU Commission.

“We need to protect our place in the EU Single Market, otherwise, we will be dragged out of the EU’s Single Market by Britain leaving without a deal. And we can’t accept that. I don’t think anybody would expect us to,” added Coveney.
His comments come as the Operation Yellowhammer document,which was officially released last night, outlined the “worst case scenario” for the UK.
Boris Johnson’s government had been massively accelerating no-deal preparations since he became prime minister, while an alternative to the Irish backstop to be put forward is also being called for.
Irish backstop
Johnson has maintained that the backstop would have to be removed from the withdrawal agreement if a deal was to be struck.
When asked about what alternatives, if any, have been proposed to the EU task force.
“If you look at the evidence, as opposed to the language that’s being used, it’s difficult not to be skeptical,” said Coveney, adding:
“There hasn’t been any substantive proposals from the British negotiating team… we know that. There certainly hasn’t been any proposal that comes close to doing what the backdrop does. So It’s easy to be skeptical here. It’s easy to be negative here. But I think the job of politicians is actually to try and find a way through the fog.”
In terms of the impact Brexit will have on some sectors, and what financial supports will be given, Coveney said the majority of supports for industry and business will come from the Irish Exchequer, rather than the EU.
However, he added that there will be dedicated EU funds for the agriculture sector as well some compensation targeted at job losses that may be sustained.
He said the funds required to some sectors, that will bear the brunt of Brexit, “will be significant”.

Making a speech at the annual Fine Gael presidential dinner last night, Varadkar said:
“During the week, the leader of the Green Party, Eamon Ryan, announced his great plan on Twitter to repopulate rural Ireland. With wolves. I would have thought the Greens’ experience of being in government with Fianna Fáil would have warned them off dangerous predators.
“Decisions are made by those who turn up. Sinn Féin doesn’t – either to the House of Commons or Stormont.
“And, I’d sooner bring back the wolves than let Sinn Féin into government,” he said this evening.
On Tuesday, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan called for the reintroduction of the animal to help rewild part of the countryside, but that idea was rejected by Culture Minister Josepha Madigan who said the government hasno plans to do so.
The Taoiseach used his speech as a rallying call to party members, stating that “when the next election comes I believe we can win it.  In fact, I am sure of it even though it may not become apparent until the last week or ten days of the election campaign”.
‘Three in a row’
He said Fine Gael is looking to do “something historic and win three in a row”.
However, he said the “we don’t want to win for the sake of winning”.
Fine Gael isn’t used to being in this position, said Varadkar, adding that going into a third election with an expectation of winning it is “a little disconcerting for some people” as it has never been done.
“We almost prefer being the underdog. So, we have to change our perspective and our ambitions.

The Taoiseach acknowledged that it has a tough fight on its hands.
“Opinion polls show that we are neck and neck and in the fight of our lives to lead the next Government. I know that we will.”
Varadkar said his party has the best team, an easy thing to argue in front of your own members, but nonetheless, he used the opportunity to hit out against his opponents.
He criticised the front benches of other parties stating, “the just don’t have the teams to match ours”.
“For some, they are lining out the same team they had in the 1990s – we refresh and renew,” he said.
Feeling the need to highlight the difference between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to the room,Varadkar said:
“Fine Gael stands for something.  You might not always agree with it, but you know what it is… Fianna Fáil stands for everything,” he said, adding that they promise “something to everyone, everywhere, every week”.
Brexit
On the upcoming Budget, the Taoiseach said the “prudent” thing to do is plan for a no-deal Brexit.
He said Tuesday’s Budget has to be “different” because of Brexit.
“So, we will not be able to afford tax and welfare packages on the scale of our last three Budgets. There will, however, be a modest and targeted welfare and a minimal but targeted tax one.
“However, I don’t want anyone to think for a second that this will be an austerity budget.  Or that there will be cutbacks.  We don’t need to take that journey again,” he said.
On the issue of Brexit, Varadkar said the government’s position has been clear and consistent.
If a deal is not possible, the government are preparing to get the country through the worst of a no-deal, he said.

THE QUEEN HASapprovedthe UK government’s request to suspend the UK parliament for five weeks when MPs return to the House of Commons next month.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to the Queen this morning about suspending parliament from the second week in September until 14 October, less than two weeks before the UK is set to leave the European Union.
In a statement released at 3pm this afternoon, five hours after Johnson publicly confirmed that he was making the request, the Privy Council said:
The move limits the time available to opposition MPs hoping to pass new laws that could prevent a no-deal Brexit before 31 October.

In a letter to MPs this morning, Johnson said the current session needed to come to a close, and that he would schedule a Queen’s Speech – laying out the government’s plans – to launch new legislation in October.
“We need to get on with our domestic agenda and that is why we are announcing a Queen’s Speech for 14 October,” he said in a Sky News interview, before dismissing criticism that the move would leave MPs with no time to debate and vote on Brexit.
“That is completely untrue. If you look at what we’re doing, we’re bringing forward a new legislative programme…,” he said.
Votes in October
Ina statementreleased by No 10 Downing Street, Johnson said that the decision is being made to end the longest parliamentary session in almost 400 years. The current session has lasted 340 days.
“There will be ample time on both sides of that crucial 17 October [EU] summit, ample time in parliament for MPs to debate the EU, to debate Brexit and all the other issues; ample time,” Johnson said.
The No 10 statement said that votes on the Queen’s Speech are likely to be held on Monday 21 and Tuesday 22 October – just 10 days out from the Brexit deadline.
These votes are likely to focus on whether MPs agree with Johnson’s no-deal Brexit approach.

The Prime Minister said: “I believe it is vital that Parliament is sitting both before and after European Council and if, as I hope, a deal with the EU is forthcoming, Parliament will then have the opportunity to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill required for ratification ahead of 31 October.”
Following today’s announcement, a petition against the suspension is garnering big numbers by the minute:

‘A constitutional outrage’
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to the Queen expressing concern about Johnson’s move.
“I have protested in the strongest possible terms on behalf of my party and all the other opposition parties that are going to join in with this in saying that suspending parliament is not acceptable, It’s not on,” Johnson said in a video reaction.

Here at home, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has said a request from Green Party leader Eamon Ryan to recall the Dáil from its summer break will be “seriously considered”.
Speaking to RTÉ’s News at OneDonohoe said his focus is getting Ireland ready for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, reiterating that it is a growing, material risk.
When asked if today’s developments in the UK will mean changes to the Irish backstop, the minister was clear, replying: “No.”
Labour MP Yvette Cooperdescribed the proposalas “deeply dangerous and irresponsible”, while the Brexit spokesman for the Liberal Democrats Tom Brakesaid itwas a “declaration of war” that would be ”met with an iron fist”.
Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeoncalled on MPsto prevent the suspension of parliament, warning that today “would go down in history as a dark one…for UK democracy” if they did not.
DUP leader Arlene Fostersaidthat her party welcomed prorogation, but did not mention Brexit in her statement: “This has been the longest parliamentary session since the Union of England and Scotland in 1707.”
Related ReadsExplainer: Could Britain's next PM 'lock the doors of parliament' to force Brexit through?
Brexit Party leader and arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Faragehas saidthat the government’s announcement today makes “a confidence motion now certain, a general election more likely and is seen as a positive move by Brexiteers”.
House Speaker John Bercowreleased a statementto say that the move was “a constitutional outrage”:
Former Chancellor Philip Hammondsaid: “It would be a constitutional outrage if Parliament were prevented from holding the government to account at a time of national crisis. Profoundly undemocratic.”
Court bid

In the wake of today’s developmentsa group of politicians haveasked a court in Scotland to block Johnson’s bid to suspend parliament.
A court challenge had initially been scheduled for Friday week, but they are now seeking an interim order that would prevent parliament being suspended until that date. It’s expected the court will hear the motion tomorrow or Friday.
The long length of prorogation notwithstanding, the government isn’t breaking any law by suspending parliament, only using a parliamentary procedure.
What is proroguing?
The suspension of parliament is known as prorogation, which is different from the dissolution of the House of Commons, which would bring about a general election.
The power to prorogue parliament rests solely with the British monarch – this means only the Queen can prorogue parliament, something she can do only after a request from the prime minister.
The UK has no written constitution so there has been some debate as to whether the Queen could refuse the request and, if so, in what circumstances.

THE UK’S SKILLS and Apprenticeships Minister Anne Milton has resigned from the role, saying she has “grave concerns about leaving the EU without a deal”, while Justice Minister David Gauke has also signalled he is leaving the front bench.
It comes after Boris Johnsonwas confirmed as the new Conservative Party leader this afternoon, with the Uxbridge and South Ruislip MP due to become the new prime minister tomorrow.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jacob-rees-mogg-prorogation-4786822-Aug2019/,"Sky NewsSky News
THE LEADER OF the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has defended his Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament, saying that the process was “quite boring” and “routine”.
Speaking toSky News’ Sunrise programmethis morning, Rees-Mogg said that the UK usually has a new session of parliament every 12 months, and this session has ran for over two years.
He denied that it was done to stunt parliamentary debate on Brexit: “Parliament will come back in early October, the EU Council takes place on 16 and 17 October – that will be when any decision is made on an agreement and then there will be 13 days after that, so that’s the key period where parliament needs to be sitting and will be sitting.
When previous statements by Sajid Javid (now Chancellor), Michael Gove (now Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster) and Amber Rudd criticising prorogation were played to Rees Mogg, he claimed that “two things are being conflated”:
“It’s routine to set out a new legislative agenda. [The suggestion they were responding to was] that you would suspend parliament from July through to the 31 October – that would have been constitutionally improper.”
He said that there would be enough time to debate Brexit, saying that amendments and statements can be made in the four to five days of debate scheduled specifically for the Queen’s Speech in mid-October and that there were three weeks off for party conferences in the middle of the five-week suspension.
“At my first and so far only appearance at the dispatch box, it had been agreed that the parliamentary recess would go ahead – parliament hasn’t sat in September for over 80 years.
When asked about Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s accusation that Johnson was a “tin-pot dictator”, Rees Mogg said:

Former Transport Secretary George Young has today quit his position as government whip in the House of Lords over Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament.
Previously,when askedto stop a “chaotic” prorogation, House Leader Jacob Rees Mogg responded to say that the House of Commons has passed the Withdrawal Act and the Article 50 Act, and that “mere motions” against a no-deal Brexit don’t count.
Speaking on Morning Ireland, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said that in the past three years, what was happening was “unprecedented”.
“What’s clear for us is we need to remain calm,” she said. “We cannot allow the slate to be wiped clean when all this change continues to take place in the UK.”
When asked whether the UK government had put forward any credible, new alternatives to the backstop, McEntee said: “No.”
“You can’t open up a truck and check whether an animal has a disease with technology.”
Speaking on BBC’s Good Morning Ulster, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said that the UK was engaged in a “dangerous game of brinkmanship”.
“The unionist population of this island do not feature” in Johnson’s list of priorities, she said.
Last night, protesters descended on the streets around Westminster to protest against Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament,chanting“If you shut down our parliament, we shut down the streets”.
A petitionagainst the proroguing of parliament unless there’s an extension to the Brexit deadline or Brexit is cancelled entirely, has reached over 1 million signatures in less than 24 hours.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-supreme-court-boris-johnson-4820568-Sep2019/,"THE BRITISH SUPREME Court has unanimously ruled that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in shutting down parliament for five weeks.
Following three days of intense legal arguments last week in the UK’s highest court, judges ruled that Johnson’s advice to Queen Elizabeth II to suspend parliament for five weeks until 14 October was illegal.
The ruling is the worst outcome that the government could have hoped for. The decision has already prompted calls for Johnson to resign and raised speculation that MPs could be set for an imminent return to the House of Commons.
Lady Hale, the President of the Supreme Court, announced that the prorogation order was void and should be quashed – meaning that in law parliament has not been prorogued.
It also means that the Supreme Court implied that Johnson, who is currently in New York, misled the queen in his reasons for prorogation.
Parliamentary sovereignty, the judgement states, “would be undermined if the executive could, through the use of the prerogative, prevent Parliament from exercising its power to make laws for as long as it pleased”.
“I am delighted today that the Supreme Court had protected the foundational principle of any democracy,” Jolyon Maugham, the Good Law Project campaigner who was one of the people who brought the case, said outside the Supreme Court today.
“This prime minister must open the doors of Parliament tomorrow. MPs must get back and be brave and bold in holding this unscrupulous government to account,” Gina Miller, one of those who brought the legal challenge against the government, said.
“This was an absolutely momentous decision,” Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry, who brought the case in Scotland, said.

Calling for Johnson to resign, she said that “his position is untenable”.
“This is a huge victory for the rule of law and democracy and in keeping with the Scottish constitutions position that neither the government or the monarch are above the law,” she said.

Speaking at the Labour Party conference, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that the ruling demonstrates Johnson’s “contempt for democracy and an abuse of power”.
He said that the prime minister should “consider his position”.
Corbyn, who has faced a difficult week over fractious Brexit debates within his own party, said that he will now be contacting the House of Commons Speaker John Bercow to demand that parliament is recalled.
In a statement immediately following the decision, Bercow said: “As the embodiment of our parliamentary democracy, the House of Commons must convene without delay. To this end, I will now consult the party leaders as a matter of urgency.”

Johnson and his Cabinet had argued that suspending parliament was a routine and long-overdue move to launch a fresh new programme for parliament – as it wipes the legislative agenda clean.
But it sparked legal action accusing him of trying to silence MPs, who oppose a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, and voted through legislation compelling Johnson to request a three-month extension to the Brexit deadline if a deal has not been reached by 19 October.
Three legal actions were taken in Edinburgh, London and Belfast upon Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament. Scotland’s highest civil court found the suspension wasunlawful, but the High Court in England said it wasnot a matter for judgesto intervene in. Belfast’s high court ruled that the matters before it “belongs to the world of politics“.
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has also joined calls for Johnson to resign. “Full scrutiny of this government and it’s plans for a hard Brexit must now be restored and challenged immediately. Johnson must be removed from office and Brexit called to a halt,” he said in a statement.
The immediate impact of the decision on Brexit remains unclear. The Benn bill, passed into law before prorogation, was designed to extend Article 50 and prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. It would push the current Brexit deadline of 31 October to 31 January.
The next steps for Johnson and his government now remain unclear. Johnson has rejected asking for an extension from the EU – despite that requirement being now in UK law – anddid not rule outproroguing parliament again ahead of the Supreme Court decision.
Whatever happens, Johnson will face significant opposition – both outside and inside parliament – when he returns to the UK from New York.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-dublin-varadkar-brexit-4800904-Sep2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson is due to arrive in Dublin this morning for a “high stakes” meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
Later, in London, Johnson will try for a second time to trigger a general election in the UK but this move is likely to be blocked again by opposition MPs.
Johnson has not met Varadkar since taking office in July, although they have spoken on the phone twice.
Varadkar said today’s meeting is “an opportunity to get to know each other better, talk about solutions in Northern Ireland and see if there’s common ground”.
Speaking atDublin Port yesterday, Varadkar warned that Johnson should not expect any breakthrough in talks on the future of the Irish border.
He outlined that he will be discussing the possibility of a Northern Ireland-only backstop as a solution to the Brexit stalemate with Johnson. The Taoiseach disputed however that significant progress was being made in talks between the EU and the UK, as claimed by Johnson and several of his ministers.
The Taoiseach’s sentiment was shared by former MP and cabinet minister Amber Rudd who resigned from the Conservative party in response to Johnson’s handling of Brexit.
Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show yesterday, Rudd accused Johnson’s government of not doing enough to secure a new deal with the EU and claimed that no formal negotiations are taking place, “just lots of conversations”.

Amid the recent resignations and loss of his parliamentary majority, Varadkar questioned whether Johnson could strike a deal with the EU, noting that “Prime Minister Johnson doesn’t have a majority”.
“So I’ll be asking him how he can convince us, Ireland and the EU, that he is actually capable or has the votes to get a deal through,” he said.
On Thursday, the prime minister’s brother, Jo Johnson, also resigned as a minister and MP over a “conflict of family loyalty and the national interest”, while on Tuesday Philip Lee resigned as a member of the Conservative party saying “it was no longer possible to serve my constituents’ and country’s best interests”.
Johnson withdrew the whip from 21 Tory rebels who are unable to vote as members of the Conservative party on Tuesday, which Rudd said was an “assault on decency and democracy”.

Last week, Johnson told MPs that he would discuss with Varadkar the idea that agri-food could continue to be regulated on an all-Ireland basis.
“We recognise that for reasons of geography and economics, agri-food is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island of Ireland. We are ready to find ways forward that recognises this reality, provided it clearly enjoys the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest,” Johnson said.
When asked about a single agricultural zone yesterday, Varadkar said that it would not be enough.
“It’s not enough on its own. I think we’d need a single Irish economic zone, or whatever you’d want to call it, to cover more than agriculture and food.”
Xinhua News Agency / PA ImagesXinhua News Agency / PA Images / PA Images
After today’s meeting, Johnson is due to return to Westminster where MPs are set to vote again on whether to trigger an early election – a vote that is expected to fail.
Johnson is seeking a snap election on 15 October as a way to break the deadlock over Brexit, but lawmakers last week rejected his call.
He is due to try again today, but opposition parties say they will veto that attempt, too. They want to postpone an election until the UK has secured a delay, removing the risk the UK could crash out without a deal.
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested that one option would be for the government to challenge parliament’s potential delay request in court.
“It will be challenged in the courts,” Raab told Sky News.
“What we are going to do with that legislation is test very carefully what it does and doesn’t require and that’s not only the lawful thing to do, I think that’s the responsible thing to do,” Raab said.
And Johnson himself said in a letter to two Sunday newspapers that his government would “simply carry on” if his election call is turned down.
The cross-party bill – which requires the prime minister to extend the exit deadline until January unless Parliament agrees a deal with the EU by 19 October -  is set to gain royal assent.
There is also a chance that the parliament could be prorogued today until 14 October but this may happen later in the week instead.

“At the 2017 election I promised my wife and children that it would be my last. This is a pledge that I intend to keep. If the house votes tonight for an early general election my tenure as speaker and MP will end when this parliament ends,” Bercow told MPs today.
He said if parliament does not vote for an early election, he believes the “least disruptive and most democratic course of action” is for him to step down at close of business on 31 October, Britain’s Brexit deadline.

TENS OF THOUSANDS of second referendum supporters converged on the UK parliament in London asking for a vote on Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.
Effigies of the prime minister and pets draped in EU flags have been pictured at the People’s Vote march to Westminster.
Walking behind a pink banner proclaiming “together for the final say”, protesters chanted: “What do we want? People’s vote! When do we want it? Now.”
“The first referendum was jumping on a train without a destination,” said Douglas Hill, 35, from Oxford, south-central England, with his Estonian wife and their baby daughter.
“Now that we have a destination, we need to have a second referendum.”
Another attendee, Theodor Howe, a 20-year-old student in Dundee, eastern Scotland, conceded another poll could be divisive but insisted it was still necessary.
“People should have a say in what is going to happen,” he told AFP.

The mood was buoyant when news came through that MPs had voted to delay their decision on whether to accept the deal, although the Johnson vowed again he will not negotiate an extension beyond 31 October.
Thomas Lambert, a rare Brexit supporter wandering among the crowds, said he was “gutted” by the vote, adding: “Another delay is an abomination.”

Patrick said the crowd has proven a second referendum was not the “pipe dream” that opponents have described it as.
He said: “You haven’t just filled a nice bar in north London, you have taken over an entire city.
Patrick added there was “nothing democratic” about the 2016 referendum.
“People weren’t just misled, they were lied to,” he said.

Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told them: “We must put it back to the people.
“This is a pivotal moment in our history and it shouldn’t be left to a handful of MPs.”
She was joined by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, who said it was “fantastic” to see the demonstration.
He added: “It’s an historic moment, we have defeated Johnson again. We are not going to let him whip out with his sell-out deal.
MP Antoinette Sandbach, who had the Conservative whip removed, credited the crowd with “changing her mind” on a second vote.
She said: “My local party voted no confidence in me for resisting no deal.
“It’s undemocratic and not what people voted for, but it’s honourable that I put my job on the line to protect tens of thousands of jobs that will be lost in the north west from no-deal Brexit.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/flights-electricity-travel-no-deal-brexit-4845418-Oct2019/,"OF A NUMBER of concerns there are about Brexit, there are some things that will be fine in a no-deal Brexit, due to cooperation between the EU and the UK.
Although there is a risk of disruption, delays and price increases in almost all areas of Irish life if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, areas that had been a concern previously, such as aviation, have been (relatively) smoothed over.
Of course, we won’t actually know what exact effect a no-deal Brexit will have until it actually happens, so there’s only so much we can say will be fine. In the cases of electricity, aviation and the Common Travel Area, however, they will continue to operate largely as they do now in a no-deal Brexit – which could be just weeks away.

This week, at aSeanad Special Committeeon Brexit, Rodney Doyle, the Director of Market Operations and General Manager of EirGrid said that it had transitioned from the single electricity market (SEM) to the ‘Integrated Single Electricity Market’ (ISEM) to safeguard electricity supplies ahead of Brexit.
“The Single Electricity Market has been operational for 12 years,” Doyle said.
“Now that we have transitioned to the Integrated Single Electricity Market, we are linked into the electricity market across the whole of Europe which is seen to deliver even greater efficiencies.”
EirGrid is the State-owned utility that operates the high-voltage electricity grid and the electricity market north (through SONI) and south (through TSO). Eirgrid also works closely with ESB and NIE to deliver that mandate.
Since 2011,a Celtic interconnectorhas been proposed as an electrical link, which if built will enable the movement of power between Ireland and France.
When completed, which is expected in the mid-2020s, it will be the only energy connection to an EU member state once the UK leaves the EU, and help to keep the price of electricity minimised.
Last week, the EU Commission granted funding of €520 million to fund the “landmark project”, with 65% of the grant (or €345 million) being allocated to Ireland.
Particular attention to renew energy cooperation unpick the good work done to date. Committee again to use its voice of influence.
Stephen Wheeler of SSE also told the committee that although the all-island electricity market must continue, that the single electricity market would be retained, but that “day-ahead coupling” would be affected, although the impact “would be minor”.
Denis O’Sullivan, the Managing Director of Gas Networks Ireland,also said at the same committee appearancethat following Brexit, the physical gas infrastructure linking Ireland to the rest of Europe will not change.

Planes
Dublin Airport AuthorityDublin Airport Authority
Niall MacCarthy, the Executive Brexit Lead and Cork Airport Managing Director of the Dublin Airport Authority (daa)toldthe Seanad Special Select Committee in a separate hearing that flights will continue to operate as normal at Dublin and Cork in a no-deal Brexit.
“If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, emergency regulation will come into force at EU level to protect air connectivity for passengers and freight between the EU and the UK.”
Currently, the UK is part of the ‘Open Skies Agreement’ which is part of the EU, and allows planes registered in different European countries to fly over each others’ skies.
“It will bring into force a range of provisions to ensure that UK air carriers can continue to provide basic air transport services between the UK and the 27 remaining EU member states, including Ireland.”
The UK has confirmed that it will mirror those provisions set out in the EU Regulation.
This will give UK air carriers permission to perform scheduled and non-scheduled flights between any point within the UK and the EU.
In addition, the regulation also states that if airlines can, within two weeks of the no-deal legislation taking effect, provide proof to the European Commission that they have robust plans to ensure compliance with EU Ownership and Control rules and restrictions within the subsequent six-month period, then these airlines would in effect be entitled to a six-month “grace period”, during which their EU operating licences and associated rights would remain unaffected.
This would help Aer Lingus continue services, as close to 50% of its shareholders are based in the UK.
The Common Travel Area
This slightly overlaps with the above, but is also distinct.
Under the Common Travel Area (CTA), Irish and British citizens can travel freely and live in either jurisdiction and enjoy associated rights and entitlements including access to employment, healthcare, education, social benefits, and the right to vote in certain elections.
The Common Travel Area pre-dates Irish and UK membership of the EU and is not dependent on it, the Department of Foreign Affairsstates.
The Government of Ireland and the UK Government have signeda Memorandum of Understanding‌, reaffirming their commitment to maintaining the CTA in all circumstances. On the date of the signing, both Governments also issued a Joint Statement.
“The CTA and associated reciprocal rights and privileges existed long before either Ireland or the UK were members of the European Union. The CTA and the associated reciprocal rights and privileges which Irish and British citizens enjoy are separate from, and therefore not dependent on, EU citizenship or EU membership.
In a statement after issuing the memorandum, Ireland and the UKreaffirmed“the immensely important and enduring nature of the relationship between our two countries and the unique ties between our citizens”.

FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL Macron has called for a “useful” month of talks to find a solution to the Brexit impasse, adding that any plan should be within the framework of the existing withdrawal agreement.
Macron’s comments came following a meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Paris.
Macron’s mention of a specific timeline followed German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying yesterday that a solution to avoid the backstop taking effect may take “two years or 30 days”.

Merkel’s mention of “30 days”was seized on by many in the British media as a potential  opportunity.
But Macron, who admitted he had a reputation as the “hardest in the gang” on Brexit, has rejected Johnson’s calls to scrap the backstop.

“We need to try to have a useful month,” Macron said, adding it was possible to “find something intelligent” in the next 30 days.
He added, however: “I want to be very clear. In the coming month, we will not find a new withdrawal agreement that is far from the fundamentals.”

The Paris visit was the second leg of Johnson’s first foreign trip as UK Prime Minister.
He added that he had been “powerfully encouraged” by his talks with Merkel in Berlin yesterday.
“I think what Angela Merkel was saying last night, if I’ve got her correctly, is that if we can do this in two years then we can do this in 30 days. And I admire that can-do spirit that she seemed to have there and I think she’s right. I think the technical solutions are there and are readily available,” Johnson said.
This weekend, Macron, Merkel and Johnson will meet US President Donald Trump and the rest of the G7 leaders at a summit in the French seaside resort of Biarritz.

https://www.thejournal.ie/home-secretary-4674433-Jun2019/,"UK HOME SECRETARY Sajid Javid has said Britain should pay the Irish government half a billion pounds to break the Brexit deadlock over the Northern Ireland border issue.
In an interview with theMail On Sunday, Javid said Britain has a moral duty to pay for a new border arrangement, warning it will take “hundreds of millions of euros, no one really knows because it hasn’t been done before”.
“I think it’s morally justified to pay for that because we both have signed the Good Friday Agreement, we are both absolutely committed to peace on the island of Ireland and – given that we voted to leave and that’s what’s changing the status quo on the island of Ireland – I think it’s morally right that we say, ‘look, we’ll pay because we’ve caused this’,” he said.
Javid, who is one of the MPs in the running forConservative Party leadership, said he would want to see this money used to set up technology-driven border checks so Britain would not be locked into EU rules.

In March last year a House of Commons committeewarnedthat there was no evidence an invisible border on the island of Ireland would be possible after Brexit.
In a report the committee stated it “had no visibility of any technical solutions, anywhere in the world, beyond the aspirational, that would remove the need for physical infrastructure at the border”.
It said the government’s proposals for technical solutions represented “blue sky thinking”.
Fine Gael senator Neale Richmond this morning criticised Javid’s comments, tellingTheJournal.iethat maintaining an open border on the island of Ireland “goes far beyond monetary value”.
“Post Brexit, we hope this can be done with a deep and meaningful trade, customs and regulatory agreement,” he said.
“There is an openness to the technological solutions suggested by Mr Javid but ultimately none of these solutions have been proven to exist yet. That is why we need the insurance policy of the Brexit and throwing around promises of pay offs simply misses the point.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/pound-slumping-4745429-Jul2019/,"THE POUND HIT a 28-month low yesterday and continued to fall this morning against the euro and dollar.
Fears among businesses of the negative effects a no-deal Brexit will have on the the domestic economy being blamed for the slump.
New UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s government have ramped up their talk of a no-deal Brexit, with the PM taking a stronger position on this than his predecessor Theresa May.
This has clearly spooked traders, who seem to have been hoping for a last-minute deal being reached between the UK and the EU, which would soften any blow the former may experience on leaving the union.
But as the October deadline draws closer and the UK rhetoric around leaving without a deal ramps up, analysts fear the pound may to continue to fall.
Where the pound is at
Sterling fell below $1.23 against the US dollar and to below €1.10 against the euro on international currency markets yesterday, hitting a low not seen in over two years.
That slump has continued this morning, with £1 sterling equal to €1.09 in euro or $1.23 dollars, as trading markets opened in Asia.
“Tin hats time: All the stops are out and the pound is now in free fall,” said Neil Wilson, market analyst for Markets.com.
This leaves the pound just 1% away from hitting a 34-year low. The slump comes at a particularly bad time for the UK as it is peak holiday season.
UK holidaymakers in Europe and further abroad will be hit with less savings as they exchange their pounds for foreign currencies.

Why the pound is plummeting
The rhetoric around the UK leaving the EU without any deal has ramped up significantly since Johnson took over as UK leader and staffed his cabinet with hardline Brexiteers.
This has spooked a lot of businesses, with lobby groups coming out to warn against the impact a no-deal would have on the country’s economy.
“The British pound started weakening sharply today, with the market awaking to the reality of a new UK government, its rather combative stance on the current EU-UK Brexit deal and its open remarks on the rising probability of a no deal Brexit,” said ING financial services strategist Petr Krpata.
Krpata said sterling’s woes were a “meltdown” and said the decline was unlikely to be over, as “politics should remain the key negative for sterling in the months to come”.
Krypta said that it was ING’s assumption that an election would soon take place in the UK and that the pound would sink to as low as €1.05 and $1.18.
Business pressure
Responding to the slump in the pound, a number of UK business lobby groups came forward warning against a no-deal Brexit, saying that the country wasn’t properly prepared for the shock.
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said that preparations for a no-deal needed to be ramped up.
“The 31 October deadline is fast approaching and businesses are being told to prepare for no deal, but there are still significant areas where there is simply little basis on which to plan,” the group said.
UK cabinet ministers are meeting this morning where its guaranteed the slump in the pound – and what to do about it – will be discussed.
Meanwhile, eurozone business confidence fell to an almost six-year low in July, according to data published by the European commission. There was a negative reading for business confidence in the eurozone, the first since October 2013.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-jeffrey-donaldson-brexit-deal-4740484-Jul2019/,"LAST UPDATE|25 Jul 2019
DUP MP JEFFREY Donaldson has said if the EU doesn’t compromise in relation to Brexit then “we are facing no deal”.
Speaking to RTÉ Radio One’sMorning Ireland, Donaldson outlined that the DUP wants Britain to leave the EU with a deal.
“We don’t want to get a no deal outcome but to be clear, if that’s the choice that Brussels makes, if Brussels decides it’s not going to compromise in any way whatsoever then we’re facing no deal and that will have consequences for the economy north and south and we need to be talking about it in that context,” Donaldson said.
However, he added that the party is “not prepared to take no deal off the table at this stage”.
“We know that is the strongest lever the UK government has in its negotiations with Brussels,” Donaldson said.
“Why on earth would the UK government give up its strongest bargaining chip at this vital stage in the negotiating process,” he said.
Donaldson said that achieving a deal is “down to all the governments” involved in the situation, not just the House of Commons.
He said this can be done by “Irish government being pragmatic and being willing to compromise in a way that protects all our interests, protects the Good Friday Agreement, protects the institutions of that agreement and avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland and does not create a new border in the Irish sea”.
‘No ifs, no buts’
Donaldson was speaking after Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to leave the EU by the Brexit deadline of 31 October during his first speech in his new role yesterday.

“The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts,” Johnson said.
“I have every confidence that in 99 days time, we will have cracked it. But do you know what, we’re not going to wait 99 days because the British people have had enough of waiting.”
Reacting to Johnson’s comments, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his suggestions that a new Brexit deal can be negotiated was “totally not in the real world”.
Speaking toRTÉ’s Six One, Varadkar said Johnson’s ideas are “clear cut but certainly not detailed”.
Varadkar said he wants to hear Johnson put some “flesh on the bones” of the comments he made during his speech earlier today, adding that ”confidence and enthusiasm were not a substitute for a European policy or a foreign policy”.
Meanwhile, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has warned Member States that Johnson’s ideas are “unacceptable”.
“PM Johnson has stated that if an agreement is to be reached it goes by way of eliminating the backstop. This is of course unacceptable and not within the mandate of the European Council,” Barnier wrote, in an email to EU ambassadors seen by AFP.
Earlier, in his first appearance before the House of Commons as prime minister, Johnson had used the same word, “unacceptable”, to describe the Brexit withdrawal agreement signed by his predecessor.
Barnier, in his message to the other 27 member states, noted the “combative” tone of Johnson’s speech, but noted that he has no mandate from the 27 EU leaders to renegotiate the deal.
And he warned that Johnson’s decision to focus Britain’s efforts on planning for a “no deal” Brexit on October 31 could be an attempt “to heap pressure on the unity of the EU27.”
“No deal will never be the EU’s choice, but we all have to be ready for all scenarios,” Barnier wrote.
Similar to Barnier’s comments, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker tole Johnson today that EU officials have no mandate to renegotiate the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
The pair spoke on the phone this afternoon.
“President Juncker listened to what Prime Minister Johnson had to say, reiterating the EU’s position that the Withdrawal Agreement is the best and only agreement possible – in line with the European Council guidelines,” Juncker’s spokeswoman said after the call.
‘This is not easy’
Echoing Varadkar’s comments yesterday evening, Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys said she wants to hear what suggestions Johnson has in relation to the Irish border post-Brexit.
“We have to work to find solutions. And that’s why we’re talking to the commission. And I said … this is difficult. This is not easy,” Humphreys told Morning Ireland.
“Trying to unravel here, years of the people and businesses doing business across the border, and also on an east-west basis with the UK but particularly on the border. And it is going to be extremely difficult,” she said.
“That’s why Boris Johnson saying ‘Oh, we can we can sort this out’, well we want to hear what he has to say. We need to hear his suggestions and what he is proposing, because there’s no point in saying we can sort of they’re putting meat on the bone.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-withdrawal-bill-4861570-Oct2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON IS urging MPS to back his Brexit deal as he launches a final bid to push through legislation in time for the UK to leave the EU with an agreement on 31 October.
Ministers have insisted they are confident they have the numbers to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) through the House of Commons, despite their defeat in Saturday’s special sitting.
However they face a fierce parliamentary struggle after announcing plans to fast-track it through the lower House in three days, potentially paving the way for the House of Lords to consider it over the weekend.
They will need MPs to approve a “programme motion” setting out the timetable for its passage through the Commons, setting up a crunch vote this evening.
Many MPs are deeply unhappy that there is so little time for detailed scrutiny of a such an important bill, which runs to 110 pages with another 124 pages of explanatory notes.
However, Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg warned yesterday that the programme motion was essential if they were to meet the Halloween deadline.
Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has warned against rejecting the current deal.PAPA
“People who do not vote for the programme motion will not be voting for Brexit on October 31,” he said.

Decision time
The prime minister also received support from former Tory leader William Hague, who said it was “time to make a clear decision on a deal that has been exhaustively negotiated”.
Former Tory leader William Hague has thrown his support behind Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.PAPA
Lord Hague wrote inThe Daily Telegraph: “There will be scarcely be one of us who does not have some fear about the consequences – in my case that any form of Brexit will slowly unravel the United Kingdom itself.
“But a failure to implement the democratic verdict of the electorate altogether would be an even greater threat to the future cohesion of the country.”
Failure to get the motion through would open up the prospect that Johnson will be forced to accept another lengthy delay to Britain’s departure – something he has vowed not to do.
The first vote today will be on the bill’s “in principle” second reading.
Despite the opposition of the DUP over arrangements for Northern Ireland, ministers believe they have the support of pro-Leave Labour rebels and former Tory MPs (now sitting as independents) who would rather leave with this deal than no deal at all.
‘Deeply flawed’
If they get through the second reading, the government will hope it gives the momentum to carry through the programme motion as well.
If that passes, under the proposed timetable, the bill would then move to the committee stage – which will continue on into tomorrow – when MPs will have the opportunity to put down amendments.
These are expected to include attempts to keep the UK more closely aligned with the EU through a customs union and to stage a second referendum.
Related ReadsExplainer: Is Boris Johnson's Brexit deal already dead?
Both are bitterly opposed by the government, raising the possibility that it could pull the bill altogether if either gets through.
Ahead of the debate, Johnson called on MPs to get behind the agreement, warning that the public did not want any further delay.
“We have negotiated a new deal so that we can leave without disruption and provide a framework for a new relationship based on free trade and friendly co-operation,” he said in a statement. “We are leaving the European Union but we will always be European.
“The public doesn’t want any more delays, neither do other European leaders and neither do I. Let’s get Brexit done on October 31 and move on.”
Sir Keir Starmer.PAPA
For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer accused the Prime Minister of trying to “bounce” MPs into supporting a plan that was “deeply flawed”.
“It is outrageous to deny Parliament the chance to scrutinise this incredibly important legislation properly,” he said.
“Ministers are trying to bounce MPs into signing off a Bill that could cause huge damage to our country. We can’t trust this prime minister.”

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told him he is confident of getting MPs to back a new Brexit deal.
The admission comes amid mounting speculation that a breakthrough inBrexit negotiationsis imminent.
Speaking to reporters this afternoon, Varadkar said: “Initial indications are that we’re making progress, that the negotiations are moving in the right direction, but whether we’ll be able to conclude the revised Withdrawal Agreement … in time for the (EU) summit on Thursday that’s, as of now, unclear.”

Varadkar stated that when he met Johnson last week, the prime minister said if the UK and EU could come to an agreement “he was confident that he would be able to get it through the House of Commons”.
However, the Taoiseach added: “But of course there are a few hurdles between now and then.”

Varadkar said it’s too early to predict if Britain will seek another extension to leaving the European Union.
DUP
Speaking toRTÉ One’s Six Onethis evening, DUP leader Arlene Foster said that her party wants a deal “but it has to be a deal that respects the constitutional and economic place of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom”.
“And if there is to be consent, there has to be consent which is in accordance with the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement. In other words, there has to be consent from the nationalist community and the unionist is community,” Foster said.
“When I hear talk of a Northern Ireland backstop … I think things are very far off the mark in terms of all of that, but it is important that we do work together to get a deal, and we will be working, certainly, with the government to try and make that happen.”
When asked if the DUP would support a deal that would put a border in the Irish sea, Foster said “it would be wrong to try and get into the modalities of all of this now”.
“It is important that we have a deal that respects Northern Ireland’s constitutional position as per the Belfast Agreement within the United Kingdom, and a deal to respect the economic integrity of the UK single market as well,” she said.
Downing Street earlier said negotiations remain ongoing amid reports Johnson is closing in on a new deal after giving significant ground to the EU over the Irish border.

The Guardian has quoted senior sources on both sides as saying that a draft treaty could be published tomorrow morning after the UK agreed in principle there will be acustoms border in the Irish Sea.
However, Johnson’s official spokesman said: “Talks remain constructive but there is more work still to do.”
Downing Street sources downplayed the chances of a breakthrough being imminent, and an EU official also stressed that “talks are ongoing”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/kevin-lunney-micheal-martin-4824113-Sep2019/,"Micheál Martin rose the Kevin Lunney attack in the Dáil today.Oireachtas TVOireachtas TV
A CROSS-BORDER STATUTORY agency should be set up to root the “evil out of the border region”, according to Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin.
Speaking about the recent attack on Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH) director, Kevin Lunney, during Leaders’ Questions today, he condemned the attack stating that the perpetrators need to be stamped out.
Martin said they have no respect for the law, and are living in their own “twilight zone”.
Lunney, who’s also the chief operating officer of QIH, was abducted from his car near his home in Derrylin, Co Fermanagh at around 6.40pm last Tuesday.
He was savagely assaulted at a second location before being left at the side of the road at Drumcoughill, Cornafean, Co Cavan sometime before 9pm the same night.
The businessman had his leg broken, some of his fingernails removed and his neck cut with a blade during the ordeal.The Irish News reportedthis morning that Lunney’s attackers carved the letters QIH into his chest with a knife.
A number of Quinn executives who had previously been targeted have received safety updates and are also receiving protection from both gardaí and the PSNI.
Paul Quinn
For too long, such violent attacks have taken place along the border regions, said Martin. The Lunney attack reminded the Fianna Fáil leader of the murder of Paul Quinn.
Quinn was 21 when he was beaten to death by a gang of eight to 10 men at a barn in Tullycora, Castleblayney, Co Monaghan on 20 October 2007.
In the last decade, 23 people have been arrested during the course of the investigation – 14 in the Republic and nine in Northern Ireland.
It is widely believed that former or current IRA members were involved in the murder.

Martin said the people living along the border have had enough, and highlighted that attacks and intimidation on workers and staff of QIH have been ongoing since 2011.
The time has come for both the British and Irish governments, as well as the Northern Ireland Executive, to establish a cross-border agency to “root this evil out of the border region”, said Martin.
Agency with teeth
He said such an agency “needs teeth and resources, task forces won’t cut it” anymore, he added.
“There is an alternative world operating in the border region,” he said, stating that the attack on Lunney was the “last straw”.
The Fianna Fáil leader said that when journalist Veronica Guerin was murdered, the government acted to bring in legislation to establish the Criminal Assets Bureau.
He said similar measures and the same degree of urgency is needed now to “take on these thugs”.
Responding, Business Minister Heather Humphreys, who was standing in for the Taoiseach during Leaders’ Questions while he is in the US, said what happened to Lunney was “outrageous”.
Humphreys, who is from the Cavan–Monaghan region, said she has known Lunney for many years.
When she heard what had happened to him, the minister said she questioned how a human being could do such a thing to another.
The minister said she stands by all the directors of the company, as well as all the staff.
She added that the attackers have no support from the local community. She told the Dáil that the Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan is with the Garda Commissioner Drew Harris today in the area, where he plans to visit the Quinn Holdings business.
It has been confirmedthat the Garda Armed Support Unit will be stationed in Cavan from this coming Monday.
Humphreys outlined to Martin that a cross border task force is already in place to deal with such incidents.
However, Martin stated that the task force is not working, stating that such violence and intimidation has been ongoing for decades.

https://www.thejournal.ie/fianna-fails-white-paper-united-ireland-4730257-Jul2019/,"OVER TWO YEARS ago, Fianna Fáil announced that the party was working on a plan for a United Ireland.
The party said it planned to publish a 12-point plan within a matter of months about how the links between Northern Ireland and the Republic should be strengthened to help prepare for the possibility of a unification.
At the time, Micheál Martin said he believed he would see a United Ireland in his lifetime.
The 12-point plan proposal was announced in March 2017, almost a year after the Brexit referendum result in the UK.
Fast forward almost two-and-a-half years, and there is still no sign of that White Paper plan. So, what’s the hold up?
Last year, a Fianna Fáil spokesperson toldTheJournal.iethat work on the White Paper on a United Ireland “is currently ongoing”.
The statement added that the paper “will be published when completed. Brexit and its implication for the island of Ireland are, of course, an important factor in our deliberations on a United Ireland”.
Work ongoing
When asked about the whereabouts of the plan this week, Martin said “a lot of work has been done” on the paper.
“We have articulated a fair degree in relation to aspects but because of developments and so on, we fell back. As you know we have entered into partnership with the SDLP and we are working with the SDLP on a number of fronts as well,” he said.
One of the only detailed reports on the issue was produced in 2017, by Fianna Fáil Senator Mark Daly, entitled ‘Brexit and the Future of Ireland: Uniting Ireland and Its People in Peace and Prosperity’.
It details what needs to be done both before and after a united Ireland becomes a reality.
When Martin first announced that his party was planning for the possibility of a United Ireland, the party leader said there was nothing “sudden” about the plan, stating that Irish unity had been a part of the Fianna Fáil manifesto since the party’s inception.

At the time, Martin was eager to distance himself from being compared to Sinn Féin, saying it was “very different” to their plan.
He said that the border polls Sinn Féin have been pushing for were “somewhat divisive and ridiculous”, whereas Fianna Fáil’s actions were being done in a “constructive way”.
This week, Martin was also keen to differentiate his ideals for a United Ireland from Sinn Féin’s plans.
Border poll
“I don’t agree with what was a Sinn Féin position originally, they are pulling back from it. Sinn Féin were saying: ‘The minute we have Brexit, let’s throw in a border poll, let’s inflame the situation.’ And I just fundamentally disagree with that,” he said.
Tomorrow, Martin takes part in a debate on ‘how to achieve a new and agreed Ireland and the form might it take’ at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties, Donegal.
Martin shares a panel with Jeffrey Donaldson of the Democratic Unionist Party and also Michelle O’Neill, Vice-President of Sinn Fein.
What will the Fianna Fáil leader be telling the MacGill festival about Irish unity?
While he said he would not be sharing his speech in advance of the debate, Martin said it is his view that the parties in the north, particularly Sinn Féin and the DUP, have not utilised the Good Friday Agreement to the full.
When asked should thought be given to what a new Ireland would look like over the next ten years, Martin said:
“I have no difficulty with that except this: politicians on the island should get on with it. The Irish people voted in a referendum on the island of Ireland for the Good Friday Agreement. I don’t like the casual way the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions have been cast aside. I have a big issue with that. It was hard fought for, hard negotiated, sacrifices were made on all fronts, concessions were made on all fronts.”
He added that Sinn Féin and the DUP “have got away with a bit, in terms of public commentary on it. It is an appalling indictment on them, on the politicians concerned. I for one cannot understand why they haven’t been restored”.
“That’s the classic, isn’t it? Don’t go down the hard work of being a parliamentarian, of being a member of government, can we talk about the next 10 years again, and the next 15 years? People know this is difficult stuff and you must show form in terms of how you work these particular agreements,” he said, adding:

https://www.thejournal.ie/phil-hogan-eu-trade-commissioner-4802703-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|10 Sep 2019
PHIL HOGAN HAS been nominated as the new EU Commissioner for Trade by the President-elect of the European Commission.
Ursula von der Leyen announced the nomination at a press conference today along with the other roles in theCollege of Commissioners. One commissioner is assigned from each EU country and the roles have a five-year term.
The positions announced by von der Leyen are subject to approval from the European Parliament before the Commission is formally appointed.
It follows Hogan’s renomination by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as Ireland’s commissioner to the EU earlier this year. He was first appointed as EU Agriculture Commissioner by Enda Kenny.
Varadkar congratulated Hogan on the role in a statement today, saying it is a “definite advantage” to have an Irish person in charge of trade.
“He has proven to be vociferous on Brexit, and I am sure that this will continue in his new role,” said Varadkar in a statement today.
Hogan said the position is “undoubtedly one of the most important economic portfolios” in the Commission and that trade is a political priority for the European Commission.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
“The Commissioners are the centre of my team,” said von der Leyen today. “I want this Commission to be a flexible, a modern, an agile commission.”
She said that Hogan is known as a “hard and a fair negotiator”.

Speaking onRTÉ’sToday with Sean O’Rourke, Hogan said the President-elect has a “major agenda” in terms of the climate and has a “great determination and energy” in making decisions based on her guidelines.
Speaking of the 28-year-old Virginijus Sinkevičius from Lithuania who has been nominated as Commissioner for Environment and Oceans, Hogan said that young people have certainly been driving the climate action movement.
Fine Gael MEPs Seán Kelly, Mairead McGuinness, Frances Fitzgerald and Maria Walsh welcomed Hogan’s proposed appointment to the role in a statement today.
“This is a very important portfolio for both the Union and Ireland and his appointment is a clear recognition of the good work Mr Hogan did as Agriculture Commissioner over the last five years,” said MEP for Ireland South Seán Kelly.
Ursula von der Leyen / TwitterUrsula von der Leyen / Twitter/ Twitter
Von der Leyen said she expects the commissioners to visit every EU member state in the first half of their term. Meetings held by the college will be paperless.
The 59-year-old will take up the position at a crucial time for both the EU and Ireland, with his tenure set to coincide with the UK’s departure from the EU.
In a statement last week, Hogan called for businesses and other stakeholders to prepare for the UK to exit the union without a deal and announced that two EU funds would be used to support businesses, workers and member states most affected by such an outcome.
“I welcome the prioritisation which the Irish government is giving to preparation for a no-deal Brexit and I urge all businesses which trade with the UK to heed the advice provided,” he said.
“The Irish government can be assured that the European Commission will continue to be available to provide any practical assistance that we can.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/mp-motion-to-debate-bill-to-extend-brexit-deadline-4794563-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|3 Sep 2019
UK MPS HAVE voted to debate a bill tomorrow that would extend the current Brexit deadline to 31 January 2020 at the earliest.
MPs now have the chance to pass all stages of the bill tomorrow. It will then go to the House of Lords. The motion prevented the delay of the debate on Benn’s bill beyond 5pm this Friday.
The motion was passed by 328 ayes to 301 noes. The full list of votes by party and individual politician can be foundhere.
This vote allowed debate over the bill to seize parliamentary time in the House of Commons tomorrow.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he is tabling a motion for the general election because he will not accept the Benn bill. He added that he will not go along with the bill and that he does not want an election.
However, he said that if MPs vote for a delay to Brexit tomorrow, he will seek to hold an election.
“I don’t want an election. The public don’t want an election. But if the House votes for this bill tomorrow, the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on October 17 to sort this out and take this country forward,” said Johnson after the result was announced.
Jeremy Corbyn said that if Johnson wants an election, he must get the bill passed first. Johnson said Corbyn would accept “whatever Brussels demands” and “beg” for a further extension.
The bill has been published by opposition MPs to extend Article 50 and prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. It would push the current Brexit deadline of 31 October this year to 31 January 2020 at the earliest.
The results of the vote followed a three-hour debate in the House of Commons, which kicked off just after 7pm. MPs left the chamber to vote at around 9.50pm and the result was announced 20 minutes later.
Johnson had earlier urged the House to reject thebillto “get the right deal for our country, deliver Brexit and take the whole country forward”.
A few key points from the debate:
Rees-Mogg spoke first this evening. He said the British public voted to leave the EU and that MPs should respect that vote.
The politician criticised the proposed bill and said that MPs “risk subverting Parliament’s proper role in scrutinising the executive” and made reference to Charles Stewart Parnell.
Said Rees-Mogg: “The approach taken today is the most unconstitutional use of this house since the days of Charles Stewart Parnell when he tried to bung up Parliament.”

After a back and forth between Rees-Mogg and House Speaker John Bercow, MPs heard from SNP leader at Westminster Ian Blackford who accused Boris Johnson of acting like a dictator.
He was followed by Tory veteran Ken Clarke who said that if parliament lets itself be sidelined, the impact on what future governments might do would be “horrendous”.
Labour MP Gordon Marsden said there is “not a sniff” of evidence that the government has presented Brexit plans to the EU.
One of the Tory rebel MPs Antoinette Sandbach said that if Boris Johnson is allowed to shut down parliament to reduce the chances of stopping a no-deal Brexit, there would be nothing to stop another prime minister doing this again.
Conservative MP Robert Courts urged MPs to vote against the bill and said it was created to “kick the can further down the road in the hope that something would turn up”. This point was furthered by MP Bob Seely.
“To vote against the government tonight is to vote against even the possibility of a deal,” said Courts.
This was followed by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas who supports the bill. Shecriticisedthe body language of  Jacob Rees-Mogg after he was photographed lying down in the chamber during the discussion.

Liberal Democrats Brexit spokesman Tom Brake supports the motion and said he has asked colleagues in the European parliament if there is any evidence the UK is putting forward alternative plans to the backstop.
He said he was told that there has been “total radio silence” from the UK about Brexit negotiations.
The UK Parliamentresumed earlier todayafter the summer recess. Johnson has already been left without a Conservative majority after Philip Lee joined the Liberal Democrats party earlier today.
Hilary Benn, Chair of the Exiting the European Union Select Committee, will propose the bill, supported by members such as Alistair Burt, Philip Hammond and Tom Brake.
Labour leader in the House of Lords Angela Smith has tabled a motion to be debated tomorrow that would make sure all stages of the Benn bill were completed by 5pm this Friday.
Boris Johnson has said that this proposed legislation intends to “chop the legs out from under the government”.
Johnson has repeatedly said that the UK will be leaving the European Union on 31 October, with or without a deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-no-deal-ireland-business-brexit-ready-uk-boris-4716639-Jul2019/,"IRELAND NEEDS TO face up to the “ugly truths” of what a no-deal Brexit would look like, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said this morning, as he warned that Irish society needs to focus on getting prepared for a UK exit from the EU in October.
Coveney today brought three memos to Cabinet in relation to Ireland’s preparedness for the UK’s exit from the EU.
Speaking ahead of this morning’s Cabinet meeting, Coveney said that the government saw the threat of a no-deal Brexit as “significant”.
“We are as prepared as we can be today. But there is still more work to do between now and the end of October,” Coveney said. This would involve working with the European Commission to protect the single market and customs union, as well as avoiding a “security risk” in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he said.
The Brexit plan being brought to cabinet today makes a number of key points. It notes that the impact of a no-deal Brexit will pose serious challenges to many sectors of Irish society, as well as economic and social life, while also warning the extent of business preparedness for Brexit is a concern.
Cabinet members will be told that Ireland can’t fully mitigate the impact of a no-deal Brexit – instead, Ireland’s preparations should be seen as an exercise in damage limitation.

The plan will also be presented to opposition parties.
From today, the government will focus on ensuring that over the summer businesses start thinking about Brexit. While critical of the “uncertainty and confusion” in London, Coveney called on all sectors of the Irish economy to consider the implications of Brexit.
“A no-deal Brexit will be very challenging. It will put huge strain on certain sectors of the Irish economy. It will perhaps be most damaging for Northern Ireland and we of course want to work to ensure that a no-deal doesn’t happen. But we have to prepare for that scenario,” Coveney said.
“It’ll be a fundamental disruption to how the all-island economy functions today in such a seamless way. And I think it’ll put strain and stress on not only that trade but the political systems that back it up too,” he added.
Speaking in Brussels today, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, where he is attending the Econfin summit of EU finance ministers, said that the Irish government saw the prospect of a disorderly Brexit as a “significant risk”.
Commenting on the new EU leadership team, which was agreed following days of prolonged negotiations between European leaders, Donohoe said: “It is very important that we have the leadership team in place now to allow Europe to respond back to protect our single market and to ensure that we can rise to the risks that might be created in dealing with Brexit.”

THE PRESIDENT OF the European Commission has stressed that there will be border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The United Kingdom would be responsible for the logistics of this border,Jean-Claude Juncker told Sky News.
There are still hopes that a deal will be agreed between the UK and the European Union ahead of the 31 October deadline.
Although frustration is growing among EU leaders at the pace of negotiations, Juncker himself said previously that it is still possible within this time frame.
With the clock ticking, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is due to meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the fringes of the UN General Assembly, which gets underway today. It will be the second meeting between the two leaders as both sides try to reach a compromise that would lead to an EU-UK withdrawal deal.

Speaking to the Sophie Ridge on Sunday programme, Juncker answered with a simple ‘yes’ when asked if there would be a border if a deal wasn’t agreed.
“I myself am not an architect of new border stations,” he said.
Juncker said that the Good Friday Agreement must be respected ‘in all its parts’:
“We have to make the sure the interests of the European Union and of the internal market will be preserved. An animal entering Northern Ireland without border control can enter the European Union without any kind of control via the southern part of the Irish island. This cannot happen. We have to preserve the health and safety of our citizens.”
Speaking to RTÉ Radio 1′s This Week programme, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said that the checks are necessary but must not pose a threat to anyone on both sides of the border.
She said it was “extremely difficult” to predict how the single market and Ireland’s place in it, as well as the Good Friday Agreement, can be protected when no deal is on the table.
The minister said it was positive that the United Kingdom that presented working documents to the European Union on how an alternative to the backstop could function, but she has yet to see them.
“We are willing to look at any proposals that achieves the same objectives as the backstop,” McEntee added.
Boris Johnson is expected to meet with out EU heads of state at the general assembly this week.

Speaking toRTÉ’s Six One, Varadkar said Johnson’s ideas are “clear cut but certainly not detailed”.
Varadkar said he wants to hear Johnson put some “flesh on the bones” of the comments he made during his speech earlier today, adding that ”confidence and enthusiasm were not a substitute for a European policy or a foreign policy”.
“Listening to what he said today, I got the impression that he was not just talking about deleting the backstop, he was talking about a whole new deal, a better deal for Britain,” Varadkar said.
“That is not going to happen. The EU Council doesn’t meet until 12 October. We have no plans to meet any earlier,” he said.

In his first speech as Prime Minister earlier today, Johnson pledged to leave the EU by the Brexit deadline of 31 October.
“The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts,” Johnson said.
“I have every confidence that in 99 days time, we will have cracked it. But do you know what, we’re not going to wait 99 days because the British people have had enough of waiting.”
Varadkar also congratulated Johnson this evening on his new position as Prime Minister, saying it is an “enormous privilege and honour to be able to lead your party”.
The Taoiseach said he is looking forward to an “early engagement” with Johnson to discuss Brexit, Northern Ireland and bilateral relations between the UK and Ireland.
“I look forward to having the opportunity to sit down with him one to one and also for our teams to meet together and really see if he can put a little bit of detail behind some of those slogans and statements because we haven’t got that yet,” Varadkar said.
Speaking of the possibility of a no-deal Brexit outcome, Varadkar said he believes that scenario is unlikely.
However, he noted that “it is a very unstable political situation in the UK”, adding that Ireland is in a stable situation with solid support from other EU states.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-johnson-debate-tuesday-4862381-Oct2019/,"LAST UPDATE|22 Oct 2019
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson threatened to pull his Brexit deal and call for an early general election if MPs do not vote for his plans as he kicked off a Commons showdown.
Two crucial votes this evening will determine whether the Prime Minister will be able to live up to his “do or die” commitment to take the UK out of the European Union by the 31 October deadline.
MPs will cast their initial vote on the PM’s Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) before being asked to back his accelerated timetable to hurry the legislation through Parliament.
But the PM told the Commons that he would “in no way allow months more of this” as he called on MPs to work “night and day” to scrutinise his plans and avoid a no-deal departure.
“If Parliament refuses to allow Brexit to happen, and instead gets its way and decides to delay everything until January or possibly longer, in no circumstances can the government continue with this,” he said.
Boris Johnson / TwitterBoris Johnson / Twitter/ Twitter
The threat was dismissed as “childish blackmail” by Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake.

“MPs shouldn’t be bullied into voting in favour of this ridiculously short timetable,” he added.
Johnson also warned that failure to back his plans would be “closing the path to leaving with a deal on October 31 and opening the path to a no-deal in nine days time”.
Urging MPs to vote for the programme motion, he said: “Doing anything else would, I am afraid, mean this House abdicating its responsibilities and handing over to the EU Council what happens next.”
A programme motion is thought to have only been defeated once before – on House of Lords reform in 2012 – and the Bill was then scrapped.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would vote against both aspects and accused the PM of “trying to blindside” Parliament with a “disgraceful attempt to dodge accountability, scrutiny, and any kind of proper debate”.
Donald Tusk gave some reassurance to MPs that a requested extension to Article 50 would be treated with “all seriousness” as he consults with EU leaders who could block the move.
“It is obvious that the result of these consultations will very much depend on what the British Parliament decides, or doesn’t decide,” the European Council president said.
The new Brexit deal must also win backing from the European Parliament, but its Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said problems affecting EU nationals in the UK must first be solved to prevent “another Windrush scandal”.
As his time as European Commission president comes to a close, Jean-Claude Juncker said it has “pained” him to spend so much time dealing with Brexit, which he described as “a waste of time and a waste of energy”.
Related ReadsExplainer: Is Boris Johnson's Brexit deal already dead?
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier also told the European Parliament that “this is the only possible agreement”, signalling it is the last deal any PM can broker.
Rory Stewart, who was among the 21 rebels against no-deal exiled from the Tories, suggested he could back the WAB but not back the programme motion.
Failure to get the motion through would open up the prospect that Johnson will be forced to accept another lengthy delay to Britain’s departure – something he has vowed not to do.
The first vote today will be on the Bill’s “in principle” second reading.
Despite the opposition of the DUP over arrangements for Northern Ireland, ministers believe they have the support of pro-Leave Labour rebels and former Tory MPs now sitting as independents, who would rather leave with Mr Johnson’s deal than no deal at all.
If it passes under the proposed timetable the Bill would then move to the committee stage – which will continue on into tomorrow – when MPs will have the opportunity to put down amendments.
Labour-backed amendments are expected to include attempts to keep the UK more closely aligned with the EU through a customs union and to hold a second referendum.
Both are bitterly opposed by the government.

https://www.thejournal.ie/interrail-passes-british-4756519-Aug2019/,"EUROPEAN TRAVELLERS WILL no longer be able to use Interrail passes in the UK from next year, with British railways no longer set to be part of the decades-old scheme.
British and European rail companies have pinned the blame on each other but both sides are saying it’s nothing to do with Brexit.
In fact, it won’t affect the UK at all as citizens there will still be able to buy Interrail tickets for countries around the continent. On the other hand, for example, an Irish person travelling around Europe on an Interrail pass will not be able to use it in the UK from 2020.
Passes bought in 2019 would remain valid, however.
The Rail Delivery Group – representing UK rail companies – said on Twitter that it was the decision of the Eurail Group – representing European companies – to boot Britain out of the scheme.
It said on Twitter: “The Eurail group has decided to end our membership from 1 January 2020, despite us wanting to remain part of the group. This is not linked to our membership of the EU.”
The Rail Delivery Group also promoted its BritRail pass, which applies specifically to travel in the UK, in announcing it would no longer be part of the Interrail scheme.

However, Eurail said in a statement it “deeply regrets” the priority from the British rail companies is to promote its own scheme.
It said it had done everything in its power to retain the British firms’ involvement in the Interrail and Eurail scheme, which is for non-EU citizens.

Criticism
The move was met with criticism in the UK, with former Labour transport secretary Andrew Adonis calling it “shameful” and “shocking”.
“Shameful that Britain’s train companies will no longer recognise Interrail passes,” he said. “This is closing Britain to the next generation of continental Europeans, just as Britain is shutting itself off from the continent too.”
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
He also said Prime Minister Boris Johnson should have intervened to prevent this.
Deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats Luisa Porritt said it “sends the message we are turning our backs on Europe”.
Launched in 1972, Interrail passes were initially designed for young passengers but are now available for all age groups.
Interrail passes cost between €20 and €400 depending on how long they last and how many of the 30 participating countries they cover.
The EU planned two years ago to give all 18-year-olds free Interrail passes but derailed the scheme because it was too expensive.
However, thousands of free passesare made available each year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-scottish-court-4836699-Oct2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson faces another showdown with the courts as his opponents look to force a Brexit extension following Europe’s critical response to the UK’s proposals for a deal.
European leaders gave his fresh Brexit proposals short shrift yesterday, with senior figures dubbing his “two borders” customs suggestion for Northern Ireland “unconvincing”.
Johnson is expected to continue his efforts today and over the weekend to convince Brussels to show flexibility on his submitted plans.
A spokesman for Johnson said his chief negotiator David Frost was currently locked in “technical level” talks in Brussels to determine whether a deal could be struck in the coming days.
But before he commences with any European travel plans, he faces a hurdle closer to home which could take the Brexit timescale out of his hands.
The Conservative Party leader has continually said, should the EU reject his proposals, he is prepared to take the UK out of the bloc without a deal on 31 October – despite the Benn Act committing him to requesting an extension to Article 50 if a deal is not secured following the European Council meeting in less than two weeks’ time.
Scotland’s highest civil court will hear two cases in the space of five days that could compel Johnson to extend the negotiations.
The legal action – led by businessman Vince Dale, SNP MP Joanna Cherry and lawyer Jolyon Maugham – will first ask the Court of Session’s Outer House to grant an order ensuring Johnson requests an extension to the Article 50 process should he refuse to abide by the terms of the Benn Act by 19 October.
On Tuesday the team will go to the Inner House to ask the Scottish judges to use the unique power of ‘nobile officium’ to empower a court official to sign the extension letter if Johnson refuses to do so.
The action will be welcomed by Remain supporters, who fear Europe’s reaction to Johnson’s proposals to replace the Northern Irish backstop have made a no-deal exit more likely.

‘We stand fully behind Ireland’
Johnson told MPs in the Commons yesterday that he had made a “genuine attempt to bridge the chasm” with Brussels by making compromises as time runs out before the current Brexit deadline of 31 October.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Brexit plan “falls short in a number of aspects” while Tánaiste Simon Coveney said “if that is the final proposal, there will be no deal”.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, said he told Johnson “we remain open but still unconvinced” during talks yesterday.
Downing Street said the proposals to address problems with the Irish border were the “broad landing zone” and the “basis for discussion” in a conciliatory move after Number 10 sources had previously claimed they represented a final offer to Brussels.
Varadkar said he could not fully understand how the UK envisages Northern Ireland and Ireland operating under different customs regimes without the need for checkpoints.
“We need to explore in much more detail the customs proposals that are being put forward as it’s very much the view of the Irish government and the people of Ireland, north and south, that there shouldn’t be customs checkpoints or tariffs between north and south,” Varadkar said.
Tusk also spoke to Varadkar yesterday and delivered the message: “We stand fully behind Ireland.”
In further signs of the resistance to Johnson’s proposals in the EU, the European Parliament’s Brexit Steering Group said it had “grave concerns” about the plan.
European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker spoke to Varadkar and emphasised that “stable and predictable” measures were needed that “cannot be based on untried arrangements” that would be left to negotiations in a transition period.
“Accepting such a proposal would not meet all the objectives of the backstop,” a commission statement said.
Johnson told the House of Commons yesterday that while his proposals do not deliver all his Brexit goals they are better options than to “remain a prisoner” of the current situation.
But he accepted that they are “some way from a resolution” on the situation.

Good Friday Agreement
Despite a critical reception across Europe, hope was growing in Westminster that Johnson might be able to command a majority for his deal.
The Tory leader appeared to be building support from the DUP, which prop up his government, and some opposition MPs wishing to avert a no-deal scenario.
But their stances could well alter if Brussels insists on changes, as seems likely.
In what appeared to be a warning shot to would-be rebels in his own party, Jeremy Corbyn said no Labour MP could support the “reckless deal”, which he said would jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement.
Johnson’s plans would see Northern Ireland apply EU rules on goods but stay in a customs territory with the UK.
This would create a regulatory barrier for goods crossing the Irish Sea and create a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – but Johnson has insisted there would be no need for checks or infrastructure at the frontier.
The plans require the currently suspended Northern Ireland Assembly to approve the new arrangements, with a vote every four years – something which has caused concern in Ireland.
Stormont voting structures mean a bloc of members of the Legislative Assembly from either the nationalist or unionist side can veto certain decisions, even if a majority of members back them.
Coveney said: “We cannot support any proposal that suggests that one party or indeed a minority in Northern Ireland could make the decision for the majority in terms of how these proposals would be implemented in the future.”
Johnson’s official spokesman said the four-year limit “is the one that we believe is sensible”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-lou-brexit-checks-ireland-4799903-Sep2019/,"SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has called on the Taoiseach to refuse any checks on the island of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Ard Comhairle in Dublin today she said the failure to stop checks being rolled out in Ireland amounts to “political vandalism” and would “represent a serious breach of the Good Friday Agreement”.
Earlier this week during aspeech at a British-Irish Chamber of Commerce event, Leo Varadkar said the risk of a no-deal Brexit is growing and that would mean “checks on goods and live animals,” including some near the border with Northern Ireland.
McDonald, along with other opposition parties have urged the taoiseach to prevent this from happening, and called on the Government to be more open with its Brexit planning.
“We’re very concerned to hear the taoiseach think out loud and to concede the point that there might be checks anywhere on the island of Ireland,” she said.
“We all committed to a bottom line which was about protecting our economy, our society, our peace process, of never conceding any damage to the Good Friday Agreement.

“There can’t be any check anywhere on the island of Ireland. That’s entirely unacceptable. It would be an act of absolute political vandalism. And wherever these checks might be located, it would represent a breach, a serious breach of the Good Friday Agreement.”
‘Hard facts’
Speaking at Kennedy Summer School in New Ross yesterday, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin made calls for greater transparency on how the Government was planning for a no-deal Brexit.
“I think we all have the right to be concerned about briefings which emerged from this week’s cabinet meeting about the impact of a no-deal Brexit,” he said.
“In March we came within days of a crash-out Brexit for which Ireland manifestly was not prepared – something the Taoiseach admitted during Dáil questions.
“Even today less than 10% of Brexit planning funds have been allocated and core customs training is only beginning.”
“I think it is long past time for the government to publish everything it has about no deal preparations. Let’s see the full details. Without the spin and with the full costs and administrative arrangements outlined,” Martin said.

TODAY, UK PRIME Minister Boris Johnson requested that Queen Elizabeth suspend the British parliament in a controversial move known as prorogation.
Five hours after his request, the queenacquiesced, in a move that will be the focus of the UK’s rolling constitutional debate.
Johnson said that he made the request to end the 340-day long parliamentary session, which he accused of “filling time” and holding back key Brexit legislation.
However, House Speaker John Bercow said that the move amounted to a “constitutional outrage” and that it was “blindingly obvious” that it was being done to “stop parliament debating Brexit”.
Former Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart said previously that he thought it was highly unlikely that parliament would be prorogued, but added that if it was, he would help organise an alternative parliament to try to stop a no-deal Brexit.
The move to prorogue parliament is a complicated one, which is exacerbated by the queen’s involvement in stopping and starting parliamentary sessions, as well as the fact that the UK has no written constitution and instead relies on precedent.
House of CommonsHouse of Commons
Duringprorogation, motions or questions can’t be tabled and almost all parliamentary business comes to an end.
The queen has granted a request from Boris Johnson to suspend parliament from 9 September at the earliest, until 14 October. An annual Conference Recess Motion sees the House of Commons break up to hold party conferences from 14 September to 2 October this year.
The House of Commons is to return next week, after breaking up for a summer recess a day after the appointment of Boris Johnson as British Prime Minister.
Is this unusual?
Ronan McCrea, Professor of Constitutional and European Law at University College London toldRTÉ’s Today with Sean O’Rourkethis morning that normally, prorogation lasts for a few days between sessions of parliament.
“It probably could be seen as unconstitutional in the British sense because Britain doesn’t have a written constitution – so unconstitutional means unusually bad behaviour rather than illegal behaviour.”
But he added that what was “pretty audacious” and “out of line” with practices over the last few decades, is that they’re pretending that it’s not about Brexit.
The Hansard Society told the Guardian that this was the longest prorogation since 1945, and would prompt legal challenges.

In March, during a series of votes on how to take Brexit forward, a majority of 321 MPs voted against a no-deal Brexit at any time, with 278 voting in favour. It’s the only clear majority for any Brexit option that the House of Commons has had.
When House Leader Jacob Rees Moggwas askedto stop a “chaotic” prorogation, he responded to say that the House of Commons has passed the Withdrawal Act and the Article 50 Act, and that “mere motions” such as the one above on no-deal, count for naught.

“…We would have an erratic, changeable and irregular system of government,” if they did, he said.
Could the queen have refused to prorogue?
Although Queen Elizabeth is understood to have expressedher disappointmentin British politicians’ “inability to govern”, as she is bound by precedent, she has no other choice but to grant a request to prorogue parliament.
“In theory yes, but in practice no,” McCrea said earlier today. “The queen acts on the advice of the Privy Council, which is her senior ministers. So in this case, the queen will follow the advice of her prime minister and ministers to prorogue parliament.”
“The only issue that might affect that is if parliament indicates it has lost confidence in Boris Johnson, but that hasn’t happened yet. She will almost certainly just accept the request, that’s what she has to do.”
Former British Prime Minister John Major has said that in his opinion it would be “almost inconceivable” for the queen to deny the request; he’s also threatened to take the British government to court if it pushes for prorogation.
The House of Commons Librarysaidthat in practice, “this process has been a formality in the UK for more than a century: the government of the day advises the Crown to prorogue and that request is acquiesced to”.

It’s been suggested by some commentators that the move could be forcing those against a no-deal to put forward a vote of no confidence in Johnson, which had been sidelined yesterday by opposition parties in favour of legislating against a no-deal Brexit.
Passing legislation is a long, complicated process, comprising of debates and amendments that would require breathing space on the House of Commons’ legislative agenda.
If a vote of no confidence is put forward instead, it could take up legislative time needed to debate no-deal legislation – another possible chess move by Johnson’s team.
In a counter move by anti no-deal MPs, there have been reports that the Court of Session in Edinburgh will tomorrow consider a petition backed by more than 70 parliamentarians aimed at blocking Boris Johnson’s prorogation bid.
Is this the end of Boris Johnson?
Dominic LipinskiDominic Lipinski
Former attorney general Dominic Grieve told Radio 5 Live today that he reckoned the government would collapse over this issue and that he would “certainly” vote down a Tory government that “persists in following a course of action that is so unconstitutional”.
John Tongue, a Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool, said that it was a “very very blatant device by the government” and an “obvious move to truncate debate”.
He said that because of the recesses for the party conferences, there was no reason why the parliament couldn’t sit “up until 13 September and then resume on Wednesday 3 October”.
“So, we’re probably looking at a general election.”
If Johnson loses a vote of no-confidence, he has 14 days after the vote to win another one, which isn’t likely to happen in this very polarised debate on Brexit.
If he doesn’t win a second one, or doesn’t try, parliament will dissolve and a general election will be called within 25 days.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-tory-party-election-prime-minister-brexit-deal-negotiations-4735618-Jul2019/,"EVEN BEYOND THE UK, Boris Johnson – who is now set to become next Prime Minister following his election as leader of the Conservative Party – is one of the best known British politicians.
From his turn as London’s larger-than-life mayor during the 2012 Olympics to his role as Foreign Secretary under Theresa May, Johnson is a well-known figure in Europe and further afield.
His election yesterday was immediately greeted by a volley of tweets from world leaders – from Donald Trump, who said he’d be “great”, toJüri Ratas, the Prime Minister of Estonia.
The man who helped deliver Brexit, however, has often found himself at the centre of criticism and controversy over his off-the-cuff comments and bumbling-style diplomacy.
As Johnson prepares to receive the keys to Number 10 Downing Street, how has the world been viewing the prospect of a Johnson premiership?
US
US President Donald Trump has long been seen as a fan of Boris Johnson. Ahead of his state visit to the UK in June, Trump praised Johnson. “He’s been very nice. I have a very good relationship with him,” he told reporters.
The US media, in the days and weeks leading up to the results of the Tory party leadership election, have been producing long, detailed profiles of the man tipped to win the leadership contest since before it even began.
American interest in Johnson has potentially been driven by theshorthand characterisationof Johnson as a “British-Trump”. The New Yorker, which has long been critical of Trump,said Johnson’s“main talent” was to “make lies sound amusing”.
The New York Times, in a profilepublishedon Monday, wrote:
The Atlanticcalled him“neither clown nor fraud, but a complex individual shaped and driven by a variety of factors”.
“He is about to enter a world in which speaking Greek matters little… in this world, of Trump and Xi, Merkel and Macron, Johnson cannot be on top internationally”, the magazine wrote.
In the Washington Post, in a piece published immediately following Johnson’s victory, columnist Anne Applebaum wrote:
Germany
Boris Johnson has never received the best reception in the German press.
Germany has often been a target of Johnson’s scorn – he oncedrew parallels betweenthe EU and the aims of Hitler.
Former German Minister for Finance, Wolfgang Schäuble,once offeredto send Johnson – during his tenure as Foreign Secretary – a copy of the Lisbon Treaty and teach him the rules of the EU.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the thought of a Johnson administration has received a frosty – and somewhat incredulous – reception in the German media.
SternStern
German news magazine Der Spiegel portrayed Johnson, who has always prided himself on his cartoonish image, as a Mad-magazine-type character.
Advertisement
The magazine’s front cover pulled few punches: “Mad in England”, describing him as the man who incites the British against Europe.
“The man dreams of being able to walk over water at some point. But now he wants to be made prime minister,” the magazine wrote.
Another news magazine, Stern, led with the headline: “What?! What is going on with the UK?”
France
France does not have the best impression of the man who once apparently called them“turds” over the country’s Brexit position. Even in 2012, French journalists were focusing on hispoor graspof policy detail and lack of concrete legacies to show for his time as mayor.
One French magazine Libération might claim to have predicted Johnson’s ascension to power. The magazine greeted Brexit in 2016 with the words “Good Luck” – emblazoning Johnson on the cover, it suggested that the vote would make him prime minister.
Since then, Emmanuel Macron has never hid his dislike of Brexiteers who, like Johnson, have taken a “do or die” approach to the UK’s exit from the EU.
In March he wrote in awidely-publishedop-ed: “Ever since the second world war has Europe been so essential. Yet never has Europe been in such danger. Brexit stands as the symbol of that.”
For many French people, Boris is likewise the symbol of the worst impulses of Brexit. Le Monde, one of the country’s leading papers, ran a piece in JunecharacterisingJohnson as “a blunderer at the gates of power”.
A recent editorial criticised his “chauvinistic rhetoric” and said that, if elected, Johnson could “taint the international credibility of a country that claims to be the champion of the rule of law”.
Even the conservative Le Figaroportrayed Johnsonas a man whose “ambition was strewn with controversy”.
The rest of the EU
Lithuanian EU Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis did little tohide his concernsin a blog post following Johnson’s election.
Comparing him to former Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, Andriukaitis criticised Johnson’s “many unrealistic promises, ignoring economic rationales and rational decisions”.
“I can only wish him luck in ‘taking back control’, spending more money on the NHS, swiftly concluding new trade agreements,” he wrote.
Mark Rutte, the Dutch Prime Minister, has become a key player in the Brexit saga. In June, he warned that the UK will become a “diminished country” regardless of the circumstances in which it leaves the EU.
One leading paper, de Volkskrant, echoed these sentiments,telling itsreaders: “Déjà vu is the word that EU diplomats and officials use most often when it comes to Johnson.”
Canada
Canada has been one of the targets of the UK for a free trade agreement. While the paths of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Johnson haven’t crossed much, the latter will be hoping he can salvage negotiations thathave so far stalled.
One of Canada’s main papers, the Toronto Star, took asceptical toneto its coverage of Johnson ahead of his election:
“Johnson statements are best taken with a grain of salt,” the paper added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/micheal-martin-no-deal-brexit-4728915-Jul2019/,"FIANNA FÁIL LEADER Micheál Martin has said the Irish government is “not ready” for a no-deal Brexit.
He also said it would be “irresponsible to provoke a general election in the next number of months”.
If then UK crashes out of the EU, “mayhem” will ensue at Irish ports, he told reporters.
“The government says it’s ready for no deal. It’s not ready for no deal. There is a lot of huffing and puffing, but I am told the ports are not ready. Dublin Port is not ready for a no deal Brexit, despite what you hear, and presentations and I am told by people who know the port, with experience of the port, that mayhem will ensue.
“So I think it’s important that if a no deal Brexit is to occur – it may not – but if it’s to occur all hands need to be on deck to make sure that the people are looked after out there, that jobs are looked after, that livelihoods are looked after and protected insofar as we possibly can. That has to be the essential prerequisite of any political party in the country,” he said.
Sense of crisis
Martin said the Conservative leadership race in the UK was “adding to the sense of crisis” and the “sense of uncertainty” at present, adding that Fianna Fáil intended to continue with the confidence and agreement in order to provide stability.
He said:
He said a no-deal scenario opens up potential economic disruption, stating the no one knows what is to come ”despite all of the analyse”.
“I think it would be irresponsible to provoke a general election in the next number of months and that is our position on that.
“I made the decision last Christmas that I made very clear would take us through to the Budget, and the Finance Bill and beyond that we’ve made no further commitments,” said Martin.
Brexit deadline
Martin said a lot depends on the reality post 31 October deadline and how the new British Prime Minister will respond to it.

“I mean for example there could be a British general election, I don’t know, the new leader could go to the country in a referendum.
“There is a context here that we need to be careful of. I’ve been cautious in speculating on the outcome of the election and what it means because some of these politicians in Britain have been in different positions in the past, have said things categorically and have done 180 degree u-turns on those positions,” he said.
Martin said he could imagine “all sorts of scenarios” once the Tory leadership election is over.
“I can envisage people looking deep into their hearts and saying: ‘Let’s go back to the British people.’ I don’t know, I am only making these points. Anything can literally happen given the personalities that we are dealing with,” he said.

With talk from both Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson that the Brexit backstop is “dead”, Martin said “things are going to get said to try and win votes”.
“I think in the aftermath of that leadership election there will be a more sober analysis.
“Maybe people have boxed themselves into a corner out of which they may not be able to escape, that remains to be seen. But I think we need to be very careful here that we don’t jump the gun in terms of any premature reaction around who gets elected and what will happen once that person gets elected,” said Martin.
The next British PM
He said he hopes calmer heads will prevail in the mind of whoever is the next British prime minister.
“I think the first reality for any leader is: power limits – there are limitations to power. Reality and circumstance will govern your behaviour and a no-deal Brexit will have a very damaging impact on the British economy…so, I think that will concentrate the mind once the Tory party leadership election is over and I think we can’t play into that game and play into the agenda that’s been set by the protagonists in that campaign.”
Martin said Fianna Fáil has always been “supportive and facilitative” of the backstop position, adding “we don’t believe in any knee-jerk reaction to a leadership election that is still in play”.
He said the UK has not proposed any alternative to the backstop.
“There should be no premature reaction to the British Tory election and I think there has been to date. People are playing into the hands of the Boris agenda. I don’t think we should and I think the British government put forward this idea of a UK-wide backstop and that was accepted and negotiated and no-one has put forward any alternative to that as I know it.”

WE’VE HAD SEVERAL Brexit D-days already – today was another.
Perhaps snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, the European Union and UK announced a new deal had been struck this morning, just hours before the start of an EU summit in Brussels.
It hadlooked like the DUP had scuppered the chances of a dealat the last-minute.
Here are the main points from today:
17 Oct 201910:53AMGood morning, Rónan Duffy here.Well, well, well.Brexit has brought the art of doing your homework at the last minute to a new artform but this really takes the biscuit.After days of false starts, we have received confirmation of a deal between the UK and EU literally as leaders began arriving at the EU summit.Here are the pertinent tweets:We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment#GetBrexitDone#TakeBackControl— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson)October 17, 2019Boris Johnson/ Twitter🇪🇺🤝🇬🇧 Where there is a will, there is a#deal- we have one!

There is no DUP veto possible within the first eight years of the new arrangements taking affect.pic.twitter.com/m1cBlfDClh— Mehreen Khan (@MehreenKhn)October 17, 2019Mehreen/ Twitter17 Oct 201911:11AMSky NewsSky NewsEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has begun his press conference confirming the deal“This text should provide legal certainty in every area,” he says.Barnier says that this is the case for EU citizens in the UK who he says were “always the priority” in negotiations.This agreement should provide legal certainty in every area where Brexit like any separation creates uncertainty and in particular and first and foremost for European citizens in the UK and British citizens living in one of our member states. These citizens have always been and will remain our priority.17 Oct 201911:18AMBarnier says that the UK had sought to reopen the negotiations on the issue over Northern Ireland. He says talks have been at times difficult.He says that Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK’s customs territory but will also remain as an entry point for the EU’s single market.“All applicable procedures for goods will take place at the point of entry for Northern Ireland and not across the island. For this purpose, UK officials will be in charge of applying the UK’s customs code in Northern Ireland”On customs duties, he says:“Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK’s customs territory, it will therefore benefit from the UK’s future trade policy,” he adds.17 Oct 201911:20AMAfter four years, Northern Ireland will decide by simple majority whether to continue applying the rules or not. This democratic support is a cornerstone of our newly-agreed approach, says Barnier.This in effect means that a simple majority in Northern Ireland has usurped a DUP veto on consent.17 Oct 201911:22AMAddressing the fact that we have been here before, Barnier says:There should be no surprises here. Much of the final text can also be found in the agreement that was put forward almost a year ago. The priority given to citizens rights……but there are some new elements on Ireland and Northern Ireland.17 Oct 201911:27AMAsked about the fact there was previous deals put to the House of Commons and rejected before, Barnier gives a longer answer but doesn’t want to go into it too much.“What do you want me to say? I’m the EU’s chief negotiator, I never wanted to give any judgement on British political procedures,” he says.17 Oct 201911:35AM“We have removed the backstop and we have replaced it with a new approach,” Barnier says.If Johnson succeeds in getting the deal through parliament, it will likely be because of this wording.For what it’s worth, Barnier says that Johnson is confident of getting the deal through parliament.17 Oct 201911:41AMWhatever about Johnson’s confidence Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the new deal should be rejected by MPs.“It seems the prime minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May,” Corbyn said in a statement.It had been suggested that up to 27 Labour MPs eager to leave would be willing to vote for a deal.

Good morning, Rónan Duffy here.
Well, well, well.
Brexit has brought the art of doing your homework at the last minute to a new artform but this really takes the biscuit.
After days of false starts, we have received confirmation of a deal between the UK and EU literally as leaders began arriving at the EU summit.
Here are the pertinent tweets:

New of the deal comes after theDUP this morning rejectedthe revised agreement’s proposals for customs and Stormont consent.
The DUP toldTheJournal.iethat they had no statement  after this latest development but referred us back to the comments issued this morning.
Party leader Arlene Foster is expected to comment on the deal later today.
The DUP’s position perhaps suggest that Johnson is pressing ahead with the putting a vote to parliament without the guarantee of DUP support.
Johnson’s government does not have majority support in parliament and the DUP’s support is crucial for any vote.
The House of Commons will sit on a weekend this Saturday for the first time in almost four decades and and it now looks like MPs will have a deal to consider.
This is the DUP’s position by the way, as laid out by leader Arlene Foster MLP and her deputy Nigel Dodds MP.

The consent issues the DUP refers to are the mechanisms by which Stormont would have control over Northern Ireland’s position within the customs union in the case of a Northern Ireland-only backstop.
Financial Times Brussels correspondent Mehreen Khan has picked out the important part of the draft agreement about how Stormont will have a say.

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has begun his press conference confirming the deal
“This text should provide legal certainty in every area,” he says.
Barnier says that this is the case for EU citizens in the UK who he says were “always the priority” in negotiations.
This agreement should provide legal certainty in every area where Brexit like any separation creates uncertainty and in particular and first and foremost for European citizens in the UK and British citizens living in one of our member states. These citizens have always been and will remain our priority.
Barnier says that the UK had sought to reopen the negotiations on the issue over Northern Ireland. He says talks have been at times difficult.
He says that Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK’s customs territory but will also remain as an entry point for the EU’s single market.
“All applicable procedures for goods will take place at the point of entry for Northern Ireland and not across the island. For this purpose, UK officials will be in charge of applying the UK’s customs code in Northern Ireland”
On customs duties, he says:
“Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK’s customs territory, it will therefore benefit from the UK’s future trade policy,” he adds.
After four years, Northern Ireland will decide by simple majority whether to continue applying the rules or not. This democratic support is a cornerstone of our newly-agreed approach, says Barnier.
This in effect means that a simple majority in Northern Ireland has usurped a DUP veto on consent.
Addressing the fact that we have been here before, Barnier says:
There should be no surprises here. Much of the final text can also be found in the agreement that was put forward almost a year ago. The priority given to citizens rights……but there are some new elements on Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Asked about the fact there was previous deals put to the House of Commons and rejected before, Barnier gives a longer answer but doesn’t want to go into it too much.
“What do you want me to say? I’m the EU’s chief negotiator, I never wanted to give any judgement on British political procedures,” he says.
“We have removed the backstop and we have replaced it with a new approach,” Barnier says.
If Johnson succeeds in getting the deal through parliament, it will likely be because of this wording.
For what it’s worth, Barnier says that Johnson is confident of getting the deal through parliament.
Whatever about Johnson’s confidence Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the new deal should be rejected by MPs.
“It seems the prime minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May,” Corbyn said in a statement.
It had been suggested that up to 27 Labour MPs eager to leave would be willing to vote for a deal. We’ll have to see how that plays out.
Here’sthe full text of the agreementfor all those who fancy it.

In summation:
“The revised Protocol provides a legally operational solution that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, protects the all-island economy and the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement in all its dimensions and safeguards the integrity of the Single Market. This solution responds to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland with the aim of protecting peace and stability.”
More from Corbyn, this time speaking to reporters.
He again confirmed Labour would be voting and against the deal and was asked about whether he will move a motion of no confidence against Johnson
“This weekend is the time to discuss the agreement that he has apparently reached at the summit and I think parliament will vote on that this weekend. All other issues are for next week,” he said.
During his press conference, Barnier was asked about what will happen if the Northern Ireland Assembly at some stage rejects the arrangement in a vote.
He said there will be a two year cooling off period and they’ll work on new measure to ensure the single market is protected.
He said the members of the Assembly every four years will “bear the responsibility of maintaining the system or breaking it off”.
“We now have to place trust in the system and those who will be managing it,” he said.
Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has been arriving at the summit in Brussels.
He had no substantive comments to make to the media as he arrived, saying he first wanted to attend the council meeting.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-party-social-media-election-4835579-Oct2019/,"AS THE UK stumbles towards an inevitable election, the progress of the Brexit Party and its attempts to secure a pact with the Tories is a fascinating spectacle.
Brexit Party membershave been accusing the Tories of stealing their policy ideas, as they grapple with the threat of another right-wing party threatening to suck the air out of their election chances (remember Ukip).
Nigel Farage has offered Boris Johnson his party’s support in an upcoming election – offering to suck up support in Labour strongholds likeNewport, Wales, where the Brexit Party is performing strongly.
But Johnson has refused that pact, and instead picked up the “Nigel Farage rhetoric”, as Nigel Farage himself put it: “let’s get Brexit done”, “Brexit do or die by 31 October”, “I’d rather die in a ditch” than seek an extension.

So, now what for the growing Brexit Party?
In the past month, in tandem with the party’s conference tour across the UK, it has been ramping up its social media, sending out slick measured ‘explainer’ type videos (eg, this one on the Withdrawal Agreement, which doesn’t explain much about it).
Other than Nigel Farage’s frequent appearances on LBC and other broadcast media, as well as the odd column (he compared Boris Johnson’s backstop alternatives to putting lipstick on a pigin the Telegraph), the Brexit Party has avoided being centre stage and focused on cultivating a grassroots base who are frustrated with politicians.

In its newsletter, it said that it had ran a number of ‘Campaign Launches and Training sessions’, and had planned to run two more due to demand.
As part of its training, it offers a “revolutionary canvassing technology – the most advanced in the UK which no other party has access to” – which is calledPericles.
Of course, this is the name of one of Boris Johnson’s two great historical figures – former Prime Minister Winston Churchill being one, andPericles of Athens, a Greek leader from 461 to 429 BC, who Johnson said “believed in great infrastructure projects and also believed in the importance of the many, not the few”.

The other elements of the training include:
“The only way to get a clean-break Brexit is to make sure The Brexit Party gets as many votes as possible!” the email states in emboldened letters.
Through the looking glass
So what’s the party’s ultimate goal?
A spokesperson for the Brexit Party, tells TheJournal.iethat their aim is to change politics. He says that the panto elements of their conferences and rallies happen everywhere, but it’s when they talk about changing the system when people really react.
“It’s when we talked about changing the system – not just Brexit, but the system that allowed the fuck up of Brexit, the system has allowed the powerful, the rich, the well-connected to take their dozen-and-a-half court cases, that allow them to do everything they can to undermine it means that you’ve got 480 MPs against 120 who are in favour of the of the side of lost and they haven’t accepted defeat.

Its members insist on calling a no-deal Brexit a “clean-break Brexit” because “there are many deals already there on air traffic, on this, on that, so it’s a misnomer”.
The party’s MEPs are only too happy to do interviews when approached, and aren’t afraid to give specific, planned soundbites either (like when the Brexit Party chair Richard Ticecalled the Irish border “irrelevant”in an interview withTheJournal.ie).
The spokesperson said of the party’s transparency:
When asked what happens to the Brexit Party on 1 November if there is no deal with the EU, the spokesperson says:
“Well. Does Brexit become a battle on a  flag with which you carry into a further campaign? Almost certainly. But it does rather depend on what happens.”
No matter the outcome, the passion on both sides of the Brexit debate is almost unbearable. So what will bring people together in the end?
“Do you think people will move on?”

https://www.thejournal.ie/varadkar-johnson-brexit-extension-4860079-Oct2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he believes it is “more likely than unlikely” that a Brexit deal will pass through the House of Commons but warned there would be no further concessions from the EU to get it over the line.
Speaking toRTÉ Newsthis evening, Varadkar also said the risk of a no-deal Brexit was “relatively low” but that Ireland’s no-deal planning will continue.
His comments come as Michael Gove, the UK minister in charge of no-deal planning, todayinsisted that they will leave the EUon 31 October, despite parliament forcing Boris Johnson to seek an extension yesterday.
The EU is currently weighing up how to respond to the extension request, which Varadkar said is a possibility.
“We have negotiated two deals with the UK government at this stage. Both of them supported by 28 governments. There isn’t going to be any further changes and I think the UK government acknowledges that.”
“But obviously there is the possibility of an extension, which would be preferable to no-deal but that does require unanimity from 27 governments and they really want to know what the purpose of this extension is.
“But even looking at the votes in the House of Commons, while there were quite a number of MPs who voted for an extension. A lot of them have indicated they will vote for the deal. So, I think it is more likely than unlikely that a deal will eventually pass,” Varadkar said.
Contempt of court
Tomorrow, judges are set to decide whether the unsigned letter sent by Boris Johnson asking for a Brexit extension from the EU complied with the Benn Act, or if the Prime Minister is in contempt of court.
Although Johnson sent a letter to the EU requesting an extension, as required by the so-called Benn Act, he did not sign it and also sent a second letter – which he signed – that said a delay would be a mistake.

A hearing at the Court of Session in Edinburgh by Scotland’s most senior judge Lord Carloway, and two other judges, was postponed until after the deadline for the extension letter to be sent under the terms of the Benn Act.
Now that the deadline has passed, the hearing is set to resume on tomorrow but the Prime Minister’s attempts to avoid requesting an extension raises questions about whether the court views the unsigned letter – and second contradictory letter – as obeying the law.
The petitioners behind the legal challenge at the Court of Session, led by Good Law Project founder Jolyon Maugham QC, confirmed that the resumed hearing would go ahead on Monday.

Addressing the legal action, Maugham explained: “The court’s role is to uphold the law – not to act as parent to a stroppy child.
“The question whether the Prime Minister is in contempt of court – as many commentators have argued – is really one for it.
“But we will supply the court with a transcript from the Inner House hearing. The hearing tomorrow will go ahead.”
He added:
During the case’s first hearing on 9 October, the Government’s lawyers assured the court that Johnson would adhere to the law in writing and before the judges – despite the Prime Minister’s repeated public declarations that he would never request an extension.
If the three judges find Johnson has failed to uphold the law, they could find him in contempt, with potential punishments including a fine or even a jail sentence.

‘A childish trick’
EU Commission President Donald Tusk confirmed at 10pm on Saturday that he had received the Prime Minister’s request, tweeting:
“The extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.”
In his signed letter, Johnson wrote: “A further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us.”
The letter, to Tusk and copied to European Council president Jean-Claude Juncker, references his regret at being defeated over the Letwin amendment in the House of Commons on Saturday.
It states: “Regrettably, Parliament missed the opportunity to inject momentum into the ratification process for the new Withdrawal Agreement.”
MPs voted by 322 to 306 in favour of amending the Brexit deal in order to withhold the Commons’ approval until the necessary UK legislation to leave the EU has been passed. The Government’s response was to cancel Saturday’s vote on the deal, with it expected to be brought back before MPs during the week.
Joanna Cherry QC, an SNP MP who has been involved in bringing proceedings to court, described Johnson’s actions as a “childish trick of not signing the letter and sending a contradictory covering letter”.
She added: “Our legal team are instructed to remind the court that as well as promising to comply with the letter of the Benn Act, the PM also promised not to seek to frustrate the purpose of the legislation.
“It will be for the court to decide whether his actions in failing to sign the letter of request and sending a letter setting out his contrary intentions are in breach of the undertakings he gave them or a contempt of court.”

It was a turbulent day for north-south relations too, as senior Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politicians took aim at Varadkar for the government’s lukewarm response to the plan.
Varadkar, who is in Stockholm today for a meeting with the Swedish prime minister Stefan Lofven, had phone calls with both Juncker, the president of the European Commission, as well as Tusk, the president of the European Council, to discuss the UK’s proposals.
The taoiseach said that he “welcomed” the proposals as the “basis for further discussion, but that “major issues remain with the UK’s proposals”.
A spokesperson for Varadkar said that he also assured the EU of Ireland’s commitment to protecting the single market, customs union and the Good Friday Agreement.

“I am reassured by what Prime Minister Johnson said today: that he is not proposing that there should be any new physical infrastructure on the island of Ireland linked to customs or customs checks – but that is actually in contradiction to the papers presented by the UK government yesterday,” Varadkar told reporters in Sweden.

UK prime minister Boris Johnson has said that he wants to get an agreement in place by the EU summit on 17 October, paving the way for Britain to leave the bloc with a deal at the end of the month.
However, European leaders have reacted coolly to the plan. Some politicians have suggested Johnson deliberately put forward a dealhe knows the EU will reject.
The DUP has faced significant scrutiny in the last 24 hours, after leader Arlene Foster announced that she would be backing Johnson’s plan – despite previously making the issue of regulatory alignment a “red line”.
Foster took aim at the Irish government today for its response to the proposal, which waspublished yesterday.
“The Irish government’s majoritarian desire to ride roughshod over unionism was one of the reasons why the withdrawal agreement was rejected,” she said.
Related ReadsJohnson preparing for 'intensive discussions' in bid to get Brexit deal over the lineWhat are the possible sticking points in Boris Johnson's backstop alternative?
She criticised what she called the government’s “preparedness to dump the consent principle for their country’s expediency is foolish in the extreme and sends a very clear message to unionists”.
DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds also targeted Varadkar:
The next few days will be crucial, as the EU studies Johnson’s proposals to see if some kind of agreement can be reached.
However, Johnson’s plan has received a frosty reception among UK political parties, as well as in Brussels, raising fears of a no-deal Brexit.
Former taoiseach Enda Kenny told RTÉ this evening that he was sure that the British government wouldn’t want to breach the Good Friday Agreement.
Kenny, who was taoiseach during the Brexit referendum in 2016, said that he “hoped that a practical arrangement can be worked out”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sammy-wilson-dup-stand-up-to-irish-4706110-Jul2019/,"THE DUP’S BREXIT spokesman Sammy Wilson believes that pressure is growing on Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to change his attitude towards the EU’s Brexit negotiations.
In an interview withBBC Radio 4′s Today programme, Wilson claimed that Britain should stand up to Ireland in order to get a better withdrawal deal from the European Union.
“Look, we know the Irish,” he said. “If you vacillate, they’ll push you around; if you stand up to them, they will start to take you seriously.”
In earlier comments on the show, Wilson said that it was his experience that the Irish government would change its negotiating stance if it met with enough opposition.
Said Wilson:
Wilson claimed that the Taoiseach’s refusal to remove the backstop – which would prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland – from the UK’s withdrawal agreement was not a stance shared by a large number of Irish people.

He also said that Varadkar had already compromised in the face of a “weak” negotiating team, although he did not give specific details.
“Leo Varadkar’s view on how Brexit should be negotiated is not a unanimous view in the Republic,” he said.
“There are many people in the Republic who now are thinking that Ireland has perhaps overstretched itself, overstated its case, and that stance could damage the Irish economy.
“I think that will put immense pressure on Leo Varadkar to look at a different attitude.”
Wilson made his comments ahead of a visit to Belfast by the two remaining candidates in the Conservative Party leadership contest, Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson, today.
Both candidates have said that they are willing to leave the European Union without a deal, with Hunt saying yesterday that he believes the EU will reopen negotiations if its negotiators believe there is a serious threat of a no-deal Brexit.
The pair will take part in hustings in Belfast today, when they are expected to face questions from party members about their proposals to resolve the border issue and remove the backstop from the UK’s withdrawal agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/minimum-wage-increase-deferred-4842648-Oct2019/,"THE INTRODUCTION OF a 30 cent increase to the minimum wage has been deferred due to the threat of a no-deal Brexit.
The hike, which was recommended by the Low Pay Commission, was set to bring the national minimum wage for adults up to €10.10 per hour, moving it past the €10 mark for the first time.
The commission’s recommendation was accepted by the government today, however the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty, said it was made on the basis of an orderly Brexit, so the wage will remain at €9.80 per hour until there is “greater clarity” on Britain’s exit from the European Union.
“The Government has decided that a decision on when the Commission’s recommendation will commence will be made when the outcome of the Brexit negotiations becomes clearer,” Minister Doherty said.

In recent years the commission’s recommendations on the wage have generally been accepted by the Government in the Autumn and come into effect the following January.
The 30 cent increase would still have left the wage significantly below €12.30 per hour, which a report from the Living Wage Technical Group deemed to be theliving wagein Ireland.
The General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Patricia King, blasted the “reprehensible” deferral of the wage increase this evening.
“It effectively means that Government has decided to penalise the 130,000 or so lowest-paid workers in the state,” King said.
“Brexit, and particularly a no-deal Brexit, will have varying impacts on different sectors of the economy. Some sectors will be more negatively affected than others, and equally some sectors will be much less affected than others.
“However, deferring the recommended 30c increase would mean that all workers on the National Minimum Wage will end up paying the price of Brexit,” she added.

RUTH DAVIDSON HAS resigned as the Tory party’s Scottish leader, citing family commitments. She is to remain on as MSP for Central Edinburgh until 2021.
“It has been the privilege of my life to serve as the leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party,” she wrote in her resignation letter, dated today.
Davidson has been highly critical of a no-deal Brexit, but does not mention yesterday’s controversial decisionto prorogue parliamentfor five weeks in the lead up to the 31 October Brexit deadline.
“While I have not hidden the conflict I have felt over Brexit, I have attempted to chart a course for our party which recognises and respects the referendum result, while seeking to maximise opportunities and mitigate risks for key Scottish businesses,” she wrote, citing fishing fleets and whiskey producers who she hoped feel “well represented”.

She said that her son Finn, who was born this year, has changed her life and her priorities. With the threat of an election looming, Davidson said that “spending hundreds of hours away from my home and family now fills me with dread. This is no way to lead.”
Answering questions from reporters during a press conference, Ruth Davidson said that she was about to marry an Irish woman, said so she quoted “an Irish saying”:

She said that Johnson had “categorically assured” her that he’s looking to get a Brexit deal, and that she believes him when he says this.
“His efforts in Biarritz helped open the door a crack,” Davidson said she was told by Johnson.
She added that she stands “foursquare behind” Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his attempts to get another Brexit deal with the European Union.
Davidson has been leader of the Scottish Tories since 2011, and was one of the leading voices in the 2014 campaign against Scottish independence.
She said today that she considered her role in that “the most important contribution of my working life and my commitment to keeping the United Kingdom together remains undimmed”.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsaid: “On behalf of everyone in the Conservative & Unionist Party, I want to thank Ruth Davidson for her wonderful service over the last 8 years. She has dedicated so much time and energy to the role & has been instrumental in the revival of our electoral fortunes in Scotland.
Former Tory leader and Prime Minister Theresa Maytweetedthat she was “Sorry to see Ruth Davidson step down as Leader of the Scottish Tories. Thank you for all you’ve done for our party and our Union over the last 8 years, and enjoy your well-deserved family time with Jen and Finn.”
Today, former Transport Secretary George Young has today quit his position as government whip in the House of Lords over Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament.
“I am very unhappy at the timing and length of the prorogation, and its motivation,” he said in his resignation letter.

https://www.thejournal.ie/foreign-birth-registrations-team-4845765-Oct2019/,"THE DEPARTMENT OF Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has established a new team to handle the growing number of people seeking Irish citizenship through the foreign births registration process.
The process, also known as citizenship by descent, is run through the Passport Service and is available to anyone who has an Irish parent born on the island of Ireland.
The number of applications from foreign-born individuals seeking citizenship has more than trebled since 2016, the same year the Brexit referendum took place.
Documents released toTheJournal.ieunder Freedom of Information show the number of foreign-born individuals applying for citizenship before 2016 was around 6,000 per year.
Since 2016, and following the UK’s decision to leave the European Union in March that year, the number of applications rocketed to more than 24,000 and has continued to grow, putting pressure on existing resources.
In 2018, the number of applications of this kind reached more than 25,000. Some 14,000 of these came fromBritain, with the rest coming from other countries like theUS,Canada,South Africaand the rest of the world.
So far in 2019 there have been 23,000 new applications submitted from people born abroad – some 11,000 of those have come from applicants in Britain.
Processing time
Applications of this nature usually take around six months, according to documents seen byTheJournal.ie,but a spokesperson for the Department confirmed that these applications are now taking up to 12 months to process from the date “all of the required documentation has been submitted”.
“The DFAT processes applications under the foreign births registration otherwise known as Citizenship by Descent. This can be a complex process that may require an applicant to submit official documentation relating to three generations.

“The Department has responded to increased demand by creating a new, dedicated foreign birth registration team by reviewing and streamlining our processes, and introducing improvements for efficiency and security, particularly with regard to identity.”
The North
Applications for Irish passports have also rocketed in recent years, with a large proportion of these coming from citizens in the North.
In 2018, the passport office issued 860,000 passports, the highest number ever issued in a single year, and an increase of 10% on the previous year.
The same year, some 84,855 applications were received from citizens in Northern Ireland with a further 98,544 applications received from Britain.
At 31 July this year, the passport service received over 486,000 applications, with around 80,000 of those coming from Northern Ireland, and a further 72,000 from Great Britain.
Following questions to the Department from the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence in March, the Department said it did not foresee a need to establish a passport office in Northern Ireland.
“There is no justification on a value for money or operational basis to open additional passport offices. The Passport Service will continue to keep service levels under careful review and adjustments will be made to the deployment of resources as needed,” it said.
In April, the DFATannouncedit was putting a €13 million contract out to tender to develop a new ICT system and employ more staff.
At the time, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said he wasconfidentadditional funding and staffing of the Passport Service would allow for the increase in demand for applications this year.

https://www.thejournal.ie/new-british-prime-minister-4731678-Jul2019/,"THE NEW CONSERVATIVE Party leader, and British prime minister, is due to be announced next week.
Despite accusations ofspreading misinformationand seemingly not being up to speed ontrade regulations, Boris Johnson is the frontrunner to replace Theresa May.
He and Jeremy Hunt, who succeeded Johnson as Foreign Secretary, are the two remaining candidates. They were chosen from a field of 10 after a series of votes by the Conservative Party’s 313 MPs.
The party’s 160,000 members have had the opportunity to cast their votes on their preferred new leader in recent weeks ahead of a deadline this Monday, 22 July.
The plan is for May’s successor to be announced on Tuesday. May is expected to answer her final prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday before officially handing in her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II later that day.
Given the looming Brexit deadline of 31 October, the new leader is not expected to enjoy any type of honeymoon period.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party could call an immediate vote of confidence in the new prime minister once they take up the role.
This would have to happen by Thursday when parliament is due to begin its summer break, or wait until MPs return on 3 September.
Chancellor Philip Hammond yesterday suggested he may vote against the new prime minister in a bid to stop a no-deal Brexit. When asked if he would back a motion of no-confidence in the government, Hammond said he could “not exclude anything”.

Some Conservative Tory MPs are pushing to introduce new rules to protect the new prime minister from such a vote,according to Sky News.
During the week, MPs in Westminster backed a bid to stop the prime minister from suspending parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit. On Thursday 315 MPs voted in favour of the amendment, while 274 voted against it.
Hunt has ruled out suspending parliament if he is voted in as leader, but Johnson has not.
Brexit deadline
The Conservatives do not have a majority in the House of Commons, but govern through an alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party.
May announced her resignation after failing to get her Brexit deal through parliament, faced with opposition from both Conservative MPs and the DUP.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the Withdrawal Agreement, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The DUP, which campaigned in favour of Brexit, believes the backstop threatens the UK and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
The new Prime Minister is expected to attend the G7 summit in Biarritz in France from 25-27 August. They are also due to attend a European Union summit on 17 and 18 October if Britain is still in the bloc at that stage.
Barring a third postponement or an earlier departure, Britain is due to leave the EU on 31 October. Plans are being made at British, Irish and European level in the event of a no-deal scenario, which seems increasingly likely.

TODAY IS THERESA May’s last day as party leader.
The PM officially becomes a lame duck today as the Tory leadership race gets under way, but she will stay on as premier and as acting leader until a successor is chosen.
She was chosen to lead the Conservative Party almost three years ago, and pretty much all of her time since then has been taken up trying to navigate the Brexit process.
When May first became leader of the Tories, she was heralded in some quarters as the ‘new Margaret Thatcher’.
Her legacy, however, has been one of repeated failures to get her Cabinet to behave, to find a way to win consensus for her Brexit deal, and to be crystal clear on what exactly her vision for Brexit is – other than limiting freedom of movement.
And she sort of predicted it. In 2002,May gave a piercing analysisof the Conservative party and the changes it would need to make, in what would be nicknamed as her “Nasty Party” speech:
“I want us to be the party that represents the whole of Britain and not merely some mythical place called ‘Middle England’, but the truth is that as our country has become more diverse, our party has remained the same.”
So, what’s next for a woman who has reached the peak of British politics, tried to reform her party, and who has been spat back out of it? Based on the experiences of previous ex British Prime Ministers (and former Taoisigh) it’s a choice between more politics, more time talking in public, or retreating entirely from it all.
Theresa May pre-Prime Minister
In an interview withThe Daily Telegraph from 2012, Home Secretary Theresa May was described as being “on a roll”, and never putting “an uncalculated foot” anywhere.
A minister also apparently described her as a “combination of being fanatically loyal, fanatically dull and fanatically hard-working”, and someone “rarely caught out”.
The policies that lead to her to being widely praised included limiting non-EEA immigrants, tackling illegal immigration, proposing a stop-and-search policy, and banning the stimulant khat.
Such was her success, that she would go on to become the longest-serving Home Secretary in 60 years – renowned as a ‘safe pair of hands’.
Will she stay in politics?

“Nice try,” was the response after May was asked at her joint press conference with US President Donald Trump will she stick around to help negotiate a UK-US trade deal.
Theresa May is still an elected MP remember – meaning that she’ll go the way of Enda Kenny after he resigned as Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, remaining as a quiet backbench politician.
But, for a woman who has suffered constant batterings from the UK media, the sharp criticisms from her party colleagues, and endless mockings on social media, she still professes that the premiership of a country she cares for is a job she “loved”.

Other former Prime Ministers, including Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, have recently reemerged in the British media to give their views on Brexit. Our own former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern has done the same, and sparked rumours that he was preparing to make a presidential bid.
Will she write a book?
Of her predecessors, Gordon Brown published Beyond the Crash: Overcoming the first crisis of globalisation, while Blair has published his memoirs A Journey.
Some of Ireland’s own politicians have had their moment in the literary sun; former Justice Minister Alan Shatter has just published his book on his departure from politics, for instance.
“Normally the option for EU leaders who have resigned would be the book offers, and offers for memoirs coming in,” Richard Moore, managing director of MComm Communications and a former senior political advisor, said.
“She’s probably at the cutting edge of recent British history. She took over from David Cameron, who is seen as one of the worst leaders Britain has ever had by throwing the dice on Brexit, and she will want to tell her side of the story.”
Will she give public talks?
Blair was at one time considered one of the highest-paid speakers in the world, with a two-year waiting list for bookings, earning up to $250,000 for a 90-minute speech, according to aDaily Telegrapharticle.
On the other hand, he’s come under criticism for using his former position in public office to make a profit: he’s denied reports that he had a personal fortune of £100m, insisting that it’s closer to £20m.
Not an inspiring speaker by any stretch, May has been repeatedly chastised for her speeches on Brexit, as repetitive, lacking in substance, and failing to unite the country on Brexit.
From “strong and stable government,” to “Brexit means Brexit, and we’re going to make a success of it,” to “No deal is better than a bad deal”, we’re left with a wealth of statements for which May was lambasted.
But she wasn’t always like that; some of her speeches from her time as Tory party chair are quite prophetic, as well as packinga punch:
She also holds a unique insight into the turbulent world of Brexit: the late-night negotiations, the high-stakes disagreements, and the lying-in-wait colleagues all around her. Let’s hope she does give us a bit of insight into that – it might at least go some way towards explaining how we’ve ended up where we are now.
Earlier this year, Boris Johnson was paid€58,000 for a 25-minute speechat the €795-a-ticket Dublin conference Pendulum. DCU’s Brexit Institute has also requested speakers for specific events, including former leaders of European countries.
So would they book Theresa May?
“We definitely would,” Federico Fabbrini, director of the DCU Brexit Institute, said.
“She has been the architect of the Withdrawal Agreement, that is still her legacy. The Brexit deal is on the shelf at the moment, and realistically it won’t be resumed any time soon.”
When asked whether her speeches would be more interesting once she is out of office, Fabbrini said that was difficult to say.
Moore said that a published book or memoir would open doors to give talks at speaker summits.
“The initial couple of years is the most important for leaders to cash in as speakers.The window to cash in is about 4-5 years, Theresa May could earn well in excess of £100,000, maybe up to £200,000 at these special events.

Johnson laughs after Varadkar refers to Ireland wanting to be ""your Athena"" in negotiations - he adds that Ireland and the eU are still waiting for alternatives to Withdrawal Agreement.pic.twitter.com/eUrE4VBZsa
THE VISIT OF UK Prime Minister Boris Johnsonto Government Buildingswas always going to be a big moment for the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar.
For the last three years, Varadkar and other high-ranking Irish political figures like Minister Simon Coveney have had to walk gingerly along a slippery tightrope marked ‘Brexit’.
They’ve had to show that as leaders, they’re representing a strong, uncompromising Ireland. An Ireland that’s not going to forget the past, but won’t let it taint too much of the future. An Ireland that’s arm-in-arm with the European Union. An Ireland that doesn’t really want the UK to get its own way easily, and sure as hell doesn’t want it to toddle off into no-deal Brexitland, nonchalantly tossing a cigarette onto the gasoline-splattered island of Ireland on its way.
But at the same time, there’s the matter of keeping the relationship between the UK and Ireland stable. Nothing can be pushed too far in this game of Brexit chess.
Which is why it was interesting to see Varadkar invoke the name of a Greek goddess in his speech when he appeared alongside Boris Johnson at Government Buildings today. Johnson is over on an official meeting with the Taoiseach, and the pair were addressing the curious press in an early morning public appearance.
During his portion of the speech, Varadkar hammered home the tough times that await the UK in the run-up to 31 October: the difficulties a no-deal would create for Ireland and its neighbour, the need to get back to the negotiating table, the ill-fated withdrawal deal.

He told Johnson that if there is a deal – and he does think a deal is possible – there will be a lot to deal with: “…it’s going to be very tough, we’ll have to deal with issues like tariffs, fishing rights, product standards and State aid. And it will then have to be ratified by 31 parliaments.”
It would, Varadkar told Johnson, be “a Herculean task for you”:
A statue of Athena in Athens.Yiannis AlexopoulosYiannis Alexopoulos
It’s not the usual thing to hear Varadkar namecheck Greek gods or goddesses in his speeches – he tends to favour more Irish-leaning references. But this was the kind of reference handpicked for a man like Boris Johnson, he an Etonian who excelled at Classics while in university (according to one of his biographers – though Johnson was annoyed at his failure to get a first in his final exams). Johnson went to Oxford to read Literae Humaniores, which is the study of Classics, ie the Greco-Roman world.
So Johnson, then, must be very familiar with who both Hercules and Athena were:Herculesthe Roman hero who was born mortal but became a god (in Greece, he was Heracles),Athenathe warrior goddess who was also Odysseus’s divine counselor, a goddess often used as a symbol of democracy.
Both emerged as part of Greek mythology, the myths created and loved by the ancient Greeks, back from the 12th century BC to AD 600 – myths that gave them figures to believe in but also provided them with moral and spiritual lessons for how to live life. The lessons in these myths still provide us with food for thought and philosophical thinking today.
Johnson must know that Varadkar was no doubt offering the example of Athena by invoking how she used her wisdom and strength to support others. Hercules was given 12 tasks (or labours) to complete, and Athena helped him with three – one of which involvedsaving him from his own madness.
Without Athena there to help, you could surmise ol’ Hercules wouldn’t have whizzed through his 12 labours very easily.
But Boris no doubt knows too that there was a reason Athena was considered a warrior goddess. She stepped in when heroes needed her help, and wasn’t afraid of taking serious measures. She turned Arachne into the first spider, and Medusa into a Gorgon with writhing snakes for hair. Athena was born wearing armour – always ready to go into battle and never afraid to strike out when she needed to.
So perhaps the unspoken message from the Taoiseach was: Ireland will be there to support you when needed, but don’t forget – the Irish people are not going to be trampled on.

https://www.thejournal.ie/hilary-benn-westminster-4816223-Sep2019/,"HILARY BENN, THE chair of the UK’s Brexit committee, has said that he hopes the EU will grant the UK another extension to secure a Brexit deal, and not “be the people to push the UK over the edge of the cliff”.
When asked byTheJournal.iewhether Brexit had soured relations between the UK and Ireland, the Labour MP said that from his Brexit committee’s first visit to Dublin, shortly after being formed, the “huge impact” on Ireland was clear.
“We saw the enormous impact Brexit would have on Ireland, who watched the referendum happen, but played no part in it.”
During the Brexit committee’s visit to Dublin today, Benn and his colleagues have met with several Oireachtas committees, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.
He said of his meetings today that the “overwhelming concern” has been about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.
The risk of a no-deal Brexit has increased since Johnson assumed power as British Prime Minister following a leadership campaign where he pledged to “scrap the backstop”. Since being appointed to No 10, he’s called it the “anti-democratic backstop” and asked for its complete removal from the Withdrawal Agreement.
The EU has said that it cannot get rid of the backstop, as it ensures that a hard border will not reappear on the island of Ireland, and it was agreed to by the former UK government. The stalemate we’re in seems to be mainly over this issue, though hardline Brexiteers insist that the backstop is not the only problem with the Withdrawal Agreement.

“Everyone is waiting to see what the British proposals are,” Benn says. “But these issues are highly complex and time is very short. It’s taken a very long time to work these things out.”
“We don’t know precisely what the UK proposals are – it has to be an insurance policy for all circumstances. It’s very hard to sustain that arrangement after Brexit, and some checks will be required in the event of a no-deal Brexit – the Taoiseach has said that.
“There are very practical questions here,” he adds, adding that the problem on the border isn’t solved by a free trade agreement. “We looked at FTAs, and they all have checks on their borders.”
JULIEN BEHAL PHOTOGRAPHYJULIEN BEHAL PHOTOGRAPHY
Benn tabled a Bill in the final few days where the House of Commons was active before prorogation; that legislation legally compels UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to request that the Brexit deadline be pushed back three months at least if no deal is yet agreed.
This legislation was fast-tracked into law, meaning if Johnson can’t get a deal and refuses to request an extension, he’ll be breaking the law. Johnson has said that he’d rather be “dead in a ditch” than request another extension from the EU.
When asked whether Benn thought the EU would grant a third extension, if the UK requested it, Benn said: “I hope so, because question for the EU is: are they going to be the people who push the UK over the edge of the cliff?”
Parliament was prorogued on 10 September, after Benn’s bill had been passed into law, and after Johnson’s motion to call a general election failed to gather enough support.
If parliament hadn’t been prorogued, Benn said that MPs would be questioning the government on Operation Yellowhammer, the government’s “reasonable worst case scenario” documents on a no-deal Brexit; and they would request a statement on the government’s plan for the EU summit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/john-crowley-interview-4822697-Sep2019/,"IT’S A FUNNY thing, to make a project as huge as a Hollywood film. Big budgets, big pressure, and a whole heap of moving parts to coordinate.
Then the film comes out and in the time it takes for a tweet to be sent, a certain opinion can be cast over the entire thing. It’s something many filmmakers experience, the latest of whom being Irish man John Crowley, director of The Goldfinch. Crowley is a longtime theatre and movie director who also brought us the much-loved black comedy Intermission and the hugely successful Brooklyn.
The Goldfinch is an adaptation of Donna Tartt’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name. It was no small book to adapt. Quite literally, as it is a whopping 800 pages long, but the story it tells is also a big one. It brings us the tale of a young boy, Theo Decker, who loses his mother in a terrorist bombing. After she dies, he takes the priceless artwork The Goldfinch, which was painted by Dutch master Carel Fabritius. The boy clings to the painting throughout his life, as it becomes a symbol of his enduring love for his mother.
It was a massive task to adapt such an epic, but Crowley – who grew up on Cork city’s Douglas Road – wanted to be on board simply because he loved the book.
“I read the book for pleasure,” he tellsTheJournal.ie. “What I was left with after reading the book was the emotion of it, so that’s the thing that really struck me. Even though it’s a huge novel, at its core is a very small story, an intimate story about a boy who gets stuck in his grief.”
It must be difficult, I venture, to be a director in this era and knowing that minutes after your film is premiered there will be red-hot reactions online. While social media is a boon for fans and critics as it allows real-time conversations about films, it must surely be tricky for the filmmakers themselves to deal with. It could be argued that there’s not much time for a film to ‘settle’.
“I mean you know, reactions to the work – it’s always better when people are positive about it than not,” acknowledges Crowley. “You can’t control that. The only thing you can control is this piece of work and your intention.”
Ansel Elgort
He’s not wide-eyed and naive when it comes to how things work in the world of criticism. Sometimes things go your way, sometimes they don’t.
“Listen, I’ve been around enough and I’ve spent a lot of time working in theatre,” he adds. “If you do any quantity of things, you will get great reactions and sometimes horrific reactions. Sometimes they’re justified. But once you see both extremes of it you realise it is not the be-all and end-all.”
You’re not, he underlines, doing anything for approval – you’re using your instincts to create the best piece of work you can at the time you’re creating it.
“That’s all you can control – and you would bend yourself into a neurotic pretzel shape if you focused on [the reviews],” he adds.
‘It was a real privilege to direct this film’
Crowley’s been in the theatre and film business a long time. Is it like he imagined it might be, when he daydreamed growing up?
“Probably not, no,” comes his honest answer. He says that when you’re younger you think if you start working on things you want to work on, “everything will be completely perfect”.
“You’re always trying to be the best you can with the material you have. The truth is it was a real privilege to direct this film and I feel very honoured to be given the reins,” he goes on. “But mostly when you’re making a film it’s so busy and so crazy that you don’t have to think about that kind of thing, you just try to trust your instincts.
Crowley with Ansel Elgort on set.
So what drew him to the book in the first place?
He says he was taken by the “original way into that scene that Donna [Tartt] had created, and of course the worlds that are in the book – the Upper East Side, contrasting with Greenwich Village and the suburbs of Las Vegas”.
“It all felt so inviting to try and visualise,” he says. The film flashes back and forth across time periods, with Oakes Fegley playing the young Theo and Ansel Elgort the older boy, 13 years later.

The visuals are indeed sumptuous, with attention paid to the set dressing and costume design to make sure the film has a timeless look to it in many scenes.
The adult Theo’s perfectly tailored suits and just-so glasses tell us a lot about what kind of person he projects himself to be. Similarly, the cosy knitted jumpers and patterned cravats that the character Hobie  (Jeffrey Wright of Westworld, in fine form as the man who takes in Theo) wears show us both that his attention to detail is exquisite, and that he has a heart of gold.
Then there’s the art which features heavily in the film, both in the scenes in the art gallery in The Met where Theo’s mother dies, and in the home of the Barbours, the family Theo moves in with after the incident. Creating the explosion scenes necessitated recreating certain rooms in The Met, while the paintings were recreated by printing images on photographic paper, and then texturing them to make them look aged.
The explosion itself is depicted in a more subtle way than you might think. The cinematographer Roger Deakins has explained: “It’s very much about Theo’s memory of the event, and we both thought it would be stronger if it was about the details and not the overall devastation. John very much wanted that when Theo wakes up in the dust, it is like he is in this kind of void really, almost to mirror his senses. And so we built on that.”
‘The past sits on the shoulders of the present’
Screenwriter for the film was the Oscar-nominated Peter Straughan (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), who Crowley describes as “fantastic”. Straughan wanted to focus on two distinct time periods in the film, and Crowley says that rather than the linear approach, flashing back and forth was “the only way to tackle” this.
“We were able to cut back and forth, which allowed us use an intimate language, and allowed us to visually land the image. The past sits on the shoulders of the present,” says Crowley. As the film shows, the same problems that were there for young Theo are there for older Theo too, despite the passing of years.
In order to adapt the book for screen, they did have to shift the order of some of the events around to present tense.
“We wrote a scene that was never in the original,” adds Crowley. “You have to be able to land what you’re focusing in on dramatically, especially with Hobie. We wrote that big explosive scene between him and Theo, which wasn’t in the book.”
The director says that by creating new scenes like this, you hope that “what you’re doing is being very true to character and the spirit of what was written, rather than re-writing the book”.
Ansel Elgort.
The film boasts a high-profile cast, including Nicole Kidman. She plays Mrs Barbour, the mother of a school friend of Theo’s in New York, who takes him in after his mother dies. But Theo is forced to move when his no-good father (Luke Wilson) and girlfriend (Sarah Paulson, in a wonderfully trashy turn) turn up. That’s where the Las Vegas section of the film comes in.
Kidman told one interviewer that she wanted to get on board when she saw that Crowley’s name was attached to The Goldfinch. “It’s very nice, very flattering,” says Crowley when this is put to him. “And maybe a bit daunting. I didn’t want to disappoint her expectations. I enjoyed working with her, especially [because of] the work she’s been doing in the past four to five years. There’s been a real renaissance in her career, it’s phenomenal.”
He describes Kidman as being a very dedicated worker. “When you see her up close she is incredibly hardworking and diligent, her preparation for it began long before she arrived into New York for rehearsal.” She was “delightful on set”, he adds. “She could not do enough work on set – she always wanted one more [take].”
Finn Wolfhard and Oakes Fegley/
Crowley is a director who truly loves working with actors. “For me one of the greatest pleasures of directing, whether theatre or film, is working with actors and figuring out no two are the same,” he says. “Figuring out specifically what will help this actor is a great task and a great problem to tackle ultimately; in both media you have to have an instinct for narrative in your story. They vastly differ on a technical level, and the [creative] process is very different.”
He describes himself as “lucky to be able to jump back and forth” between theatre and film. “They really shake you up and challenge you”. While filmmaking can be a long and drawn out process, there’s a totally different sense of speed to theatre, one that Crowley describes as “thrilling” and “terrifying”.
Next up for Crowley is Local Hero, which will be on stage in the Old Vic in London in 2020. In the works is also a film adaptation of Midwinter Break, the novel by Irish writer Bernard McLaverty.
But in between all that, there’s the matter of living in London – his base for two decades – during Brexit. He describes the British exit from the EU as “really shocking”: “It’s very hard to make sense of why the country is doing this to itself.”
“Like a lot of people who come here, there are certain things that I love about this country,” says Crowley. “You don’t realise what they are until they are challenged or sidelined. It seems surreal.”
The Goldfinch is in cinemas from Friday.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR hopes to meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson next week to discuss the ongoing deadlock over Brexit.
“We’re working on two possible dates and we’ll confirm them as soon as they are confirmed,” he said today.
Speaking to reporters in Dun Laoghaire this morning, Varadkar said he was open to listening to any proposals from Johnson that would remove the need for a backstop, as long as it did not return a hard border to the island of Ireland.
“As I’ve always said, I’m always willing to listen to any proposals that a British Prime Minister has.
His comments follow a report in The Guardian which claimed that leaked British government documents found all alternatives to the backstop to be “fraught with difficulties”.
The documentssummarised the findings of the British government’s official “alternative arrangements” working groups, and concluded that smaller businesses in Northern Ireland will struggle to cope post-Brexit under the proposed alternative solutions.

Varadkar also said that any proposals he had seen for alternative arrangements so far “just manage the border”.
“They facilitate tariffs, they facilitate checks, they facilitate controls, but try to do it in a way that’s invisible and unobtrusive and that’s better than nothing – but it’s not the outcome that we want to achieve,” he said.
The Taoiseach described the current situation, as MPs prepare to return to parliament in Westminster tomorrow, as “very volatile and dynamic”.

“I could very easily say something today or make an initiative today and find out in 48 hours that it’s totally out of date, so I think we have to allow things to develop in Westminster in particular in the next week and review the situation again next week.”
The Irish Cabinet would hold its first post-summer meeting tomorrow, he said, and ministers would be discussing “a new memo on no-deal planning, because we have to be prepared for no-deal on the 31 October”.
The British Cabinet will meet later this afternoon, Johnson confirmed.
A no-deal exit, Varadkar said today, “is increasingly likely, we need to be prepared for that”.
Asked when businesses would be told of contingency plans for no-deal, he said announcements would be made well in advance of 31 October.
He said the government would not be making last-minute announcements about animal or food checks that would require businesses to respond “the next day or three days later, so anything that’s done will have a lead-in time”.
Answering a question about US Vice President Mike Pence’s visit to Dublin tomorrow, the Taoiseach said he would use the opportunity to further outline Ireland’s position on Brexit to the Trump administration.

Britain is due to leave the European Union on 31 October. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will not accept the backstop arrangement but has maintained that “abundant solutions” are available.
A newly leaked report, however, shows there is no single, deliverable alternative.
The report, according to the Guardian, said: “It is evident that every facilitation has concerns and issues related to them. The complexity of combining them into something more systemic and as part of one package is a key missing factor at present.”
The backstop ensures that Northern Ireland would stay “aligned” to the regulations of the single market and the customs union if there is still no other solution that would avoid infrastructure along the Irish border.

To avoid a border, it means there would have to be the same or similar custom rules and regulations for products, food, animals and vehicles between the UK and the EU – or Northern Ireland and the EU.
The official report summarises the work of two groups tasked with coming up with border ideas.
Border solutions with the most potential listed in the report include:
Significant concerns are raised in the report about an artificial intelligence option, which experts felt might not detect disease and chemical contamination of food.
On-board vehicle technology which could track the location, weight and temperature of goods was also considered risky if a lorry is suddenly taken out of service and goods offloaded into a non-registered vehicle.
Physical goods checks through mobile units could also take weeks and involve lengthy periods of quarantine, the report found. The units could also be vulnerable to “targeting” and staff could be at risk, it said.
The report also found that additional administration could hit small businesses in Northern Ireland, according to the Guardian.
No comment
The UK’s Department for Exiting the European Union declined to comment on the leaked report.
Meanwhile, UK cabinet minister Michael Gove hasrefusedto guarantee his government would abide by legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit if it passes after being proposed by MPs this week.

https://www.thejournal.ie/yellowhammer-brexit-boris-4805616-Sep2019/,"THE UK LABOUR Party has called for parliament to be recalled, after Operation Yellowhammer documents published yesterday warned a no-deal Brexit could lead to the return of a hard border in Ireland.
On 13 March, the government said there would be no new checks or controls on goods moving from Ireland to Northern Irelandin the event of a no-deal Brexit.
And, despite the UK government’s wish not to install any border checks in Ireland, the official papers say that “this model is likely to prove unsustainable due to significant economic, legal and biosecurity risks”.
It also says that in Northern Ireland, “the automatic application of the EU tariff and regulatory requirements for goods entering Ireland will severely disrupt trade”.
The UK government expects that some businesses will stop trade or relocate to avoid paying these tariffs which will make them “uncompetitive”. For those who continue to trade, they would “experience higher costs which may be passed on to customers”.
It says the agri-food sector would be hardest hit, given its reliance on cross-border supply chains and the tariffs that would then apply.
“Disruption to key sectors and job losses are likely to result in protests and direct action with road blockages,” the Yellowhammer documents say.
Yesterday, the PSNI chief constable Simon Byrnecalled for an extra 800 officers to help deal with the dissident threat. A no-deal scenario would also exacerbate this threat, the documents say.
Elsewhere, Operation Yellowhammer also says that there would be a “rise in public disorder and community tensions” across the UK after a no-deal Brexit.
Preparedness for a no deal remains “at a low level”, it says, with logjams at Channel ports threatening to impact supplies.
It adds: “Low income groups will be disproportionately affected by any price rises in food and fuel.”

‘A reasonable worst case scenario’
The UK government was aiming to play down the implications of the Yellowhammer documents yesterday,which had been previously leaked to the Sunday Times.
It stressed that it was “updating the assumptions” in the document, and that it was “neither an impact assessment, nor a prediction of what is most likely to happen.
“It describes what could occur in a reasonable worst case scenario,” wrote minister Michael Gove.
Boris Johnson’s government will also appeal the Scottish court ruling which ruled that suspending parliamentfor five weeks was “unlawful”.
A spokesman said it was “disappointed” by the decision and would appeal to the Supreme Court.
“The UK government needs to bring forward a strong domestic legislative agenda. Proroguing parliament is the legal and necessary way of delivering this,” he said.
However, the opposition has called for parliament to be immediately recalled given the looming threat of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.
“I urge the prime minister to immediately recall parliament so we can debate this judgement and decide what happens next,” said Labour’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer.
However, a government source told AFP that “nothing is changing” until the case was concluded.
Later, Johnson took questions from the public in a live address on Facebook, where he was asked if he was the “leader of an authoritarian regime”.
“I must respectfully disagree with you,” he replied, adding: “What we’re trying to do is to implement the result of the 2016 referendum.”

The Sunday Telegraph reported this morningthat Johnson had accepted an offer from Varadkar to meet to try to break the Brexit deadlock.
It comes after Varadkar and Johnson spoke over the phone nearly two weeks ago.
Johnson has insisted that the EU should agree to drop the Northern Ireland backstop provision of the Withdrawal Agreement. The backstop is designed to ensure that there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland.

The EU has stood firm, however, with leaders refusing to agree to drop the backstop. This tension is setting the UK on a course to crash out of the EU on 31 October with no deal.
A spokesperson for Varadkar confirmed this afternoon that he had invited Johnson to Dublin for talks on Northern Ireland and Brexit.
“Their offices are in contact to agree a date for these talks in the coming weeks,” the spokesperson said.
“Such a meeting would give both sides an opportunity to gain a better understanding of their respective positions,” the spokesperson said.
“As has repeatedly been made clear, the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop are not up for negotiation.

The Letwin amendment, a cross-party bid to seek an extension to ensure legislation backing up the new Brexit deal is through the House before the end of the month, was passed this afternoon by a margin of322 to 306.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson is due to outline his final Brexit offer to the EU today, as he has been accused of deliberately putting forward a deal he knows the bloc will reject.
The proposals are expected to stress there will be no delay to Britain leaving the European Union beyond the current deadline of 31 October.
Johnson will use his speech at the Conservative Party conference to say “we can, we must and we will” get Brexit done because voters feel they are being “taken for fools” by Westminster’s politicians.
The prime minister is expected to unveil a “two borders for four years” plan that will leave Northern Ireland in a relationship with Europe until 2025, according to the Daily Telegraph.
The proposals would see the UK as a whole remaining in the EU for a transition period until the end of 2021 and Northern Ireland remaining part of the Single Market until at least 2025 but leaving the Customs Union with the rest of the UK.
A senior EU source told RTÉ News this scenario isnot legally workable.
Johnson is expected to tell the EU this is his government’s final offer and that no more talks will take place until after Brexit – making a hard Brexit increasingly likely.
The prime minister will restate his commitment to the 31 October deadline despite legislation aimed at preventing him taking the UK out of the EU without a deal unless he has the consent of the British Parliament.
In his speech in Manchester, the prime minister will say: “Voters are desperate for us to focus on their other priorities – what people want, what leavers want, what remainers want, what the whole world wants – is to move on.
“That is why we are coming out of the EU on October 31. Let’s get Brexit done – we can, we must and we will.”

‘Brexit Godfather’
In recent days, Irish and European politicians have hit out at Johnson’s plans for Northern Ireland.
SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood MLA today confirmed he has written to the leaders of the major Westminster parties urging them to cooperate to remove Johnson from office.
“Boris Johnson’s reported offer to the European Union literally doubles down on his hard border plan. A regulatory border in the Irish Sea and a customs border across this island will strangle the local economy and runs contrary to the interests of communities and businesses here.
Eastwood said he has written to the leaders of the Labour Party, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats “asking them to take part in an unprecedented act of political selflessness to stop this chaos and protect the fragile interests of Northern Ireland”.
“They must come together, pass a motion of no confidence in Johnson and unite behind a common candidate as a temporary measure to extend the Article 50 period,” Eastwood said.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Prime Timelast night, Lisa Chambers, Fianna Fáil’s Spokesperson on Brexit, also questioned the British government’s approach.

“I think that a deal can be done and I think that Boris Johnson is running out of options.
“And you’d have to ask the question, are they putting those proposals there knowing they’ll be rejected because they’re pursuing a no-deal policy? I sincerely hope that’s no the case, for everybody’s sake,” Chambers said.
On the same programme, Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee said that customs checks and a time-limited backstop were “not acceptable”. She stressed there can be no infrastructure or associated checks along the border, as set out under the Good Friday Agreement, adding that Johnson needs to present “something credible”.

IRELAND IS IN the eye of the Brexit storm, according to Tánaiste Simon Coveney today.
Speaking in Denmark, Coveney said the many, many hours, days, weeks and months of Brexit negotiations “are not going to be brushed aside now” despite what the UK Prime Minister said in Berlin yesterday.
“Ireland, unfortunately, is in the eye of the storm here. Because it’s issues on the island of Ireland that seem to be the source of disagreement at the moment. So we will work to try to change that,” he said.
While Coveney said the “extraordinary expression of EU solidarity with a small country like Ireland” has been “very reassuring” the Tánaiste said all eyes are on how Ireland is now being treated by the EU.
How vulnerable, smaller States are treated
As pressure mounts on whether the EU will concede to Britain’s demand to remove the backstop from the withdrawal agreement, Coveney said Brexit has resulted in a “questioning of what solidarity means in the European Union, for a small vulnerable member state like Ireland, which is really exposed to the downside of Brexit, if it’s not handled in a responsible way”.
“A lot of other smaller countries are now looking at how Ireland is being treated,” he said, adding that smaller countries, such as Denmark, which Coveney said has similarities with Ireland in terms of population, might one day find itself in its own difficulties in the future, and need support.

Ratcheting up the pressure to continue their support of Ireland, Coveney added that smaller nations in the EU are “getting a lot of reassurance that if it was them they would be getting the same level of solidarity and support from bigger countries”.
Backstop
Speaking about the withdrawal agreement, Coveney said he wanted to “make it very clear that the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation”.
“The now famous backstop in that withdrawal agreement, which is simply an insurance mechanism, that if all else fails, we have a way that we know works of ensuring that we don’t see physical border infrastructure with all of the divisive politics that comes with that reemerging on the island of Ireland. Surely that’s not an unreasonable ask, that the fallback mechanism would be there.”
Coveney said the EU will listen to the UK in relation to what alternative arrangements it comes up with. However, in acolumn forTheJournal.ietoday, he wrote that any alternatives put forward by the UK would likely be “far inferior” and would damage Ireland.
“Brexit is an extraordinary disruptor” which is why the agreements that have been made between the UK and the EU are so important, he said to reporters today.
His comments come as Boris Johnson visits Paris today, after his trip to Berlin yesterday saw German Chancellor Angela Merkel offer a “30-day” window for the UK to come up with an alternative solution to replace the controversial backstop.
On the second leg of his first foreign visit since taking office, Johnson will meet his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee palace to stress that elements of the UK’s impending exit from the EU must be renegotiated.

https://www.thejournal.ie/explainer-prorogue-4718675-Jul2019/,"ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER extraordinary development in the tale of Brexit.
Yesterday it was athreat by former prime minister John Majorto take legal action against the decision of a future prime minister, most likely Boris Johnson, over the potential suspension of parliament to force Brexit through.
It comes after Johnson has refused to rule out proroguing parliament should it seek to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.
But what would it mean to ‘prorogue’ parliament and why has it become the latest fissure among senior Tories?
Well, in large part it’s about numbers.
The House of Commons has found it next-to-impossible to agree a way forward on Brexit, butin March a majority did vote to rule out a no-deal exit.
The vote does not stop a no-deal from happening but it does demonstrate that the House of Commons is not in favour of such an outcome.
The election of a new Prime Minister alone, be it Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, is unlikely to change the numbers so the new leader will face the same one as his predecessor.
It has been suggested that one way for the next Prime Minister to ensure Brexit happens one way or another and without thedissent of the House of Commons is to simplyend the current parliamentary session.
The suspension of parliament is known as prorogation but it is different from the dissolution of the house, which would necessitate a general election.
It’s been suggested that the end of the parliamentary session would last only a couple of weeks, enough to see Brexit through but also having the effect of making it impossible for Brexit bills to be passed in the house.
So, does the PM have the power to do this?
No, what complicates this matter further is that the power to prorogue parliament rests with the British monarch.
This means only the queen can prorogue parliament, something she would do after a request from the prime minister.
The UK has no written constitution so there is some debate as to whether the queen could refuse the request and, if so, in what circumstances.

Major said yesterday that in his opinion that it would be “almost inconceivable” for the queen to deny the request.
Former British prime minister John Major.Yui Mok / PA ImagesYui Mok / PA Images / PA Images
The former prime minister said it is in those circumstances that he would launch a legal challenge. Crucially though, such a challenge could not be taken on the actual granting of the prorogue itself.
The queen is the highest authority in the UK and as such she is immune from the legal process. The courts derive their power from her rather than vice versa.
So what Major and others have argued is that the prime minister’s advice to the queencouldbe challenged and that this would be the legal route taken.
By way of looking at precedent, British QC David Pannick recently cited a Canadian example that could be seen as similar.
Writingin The Times, Pannick detailed the instance in 2008 when Canada’s minister asked the governor-general to prorogue parliament to avoid a vote of no confidence.
The governor-general, who is the monarch’s representative in Canada, granted the request but also took the view that she was able to refuse the request if she wished.
“If the issue arises in October in the UK, the Queen would be at the centre of a political storm whatever her decision,” Pannick wrote.
“Buckingham Palace advisers would be likely to welcome a challenge to the legality of the prime minister’s advice.
Johnson and the queen meeting in Buckingham Palace last year.Jonathan BradyJonathan Brady
Up until now all this talk has been rather speculative. But with Johnson refusing to rule it out and Major now openly considering the prospect, the issue is one that will continue to bubble in the background as the next leader takes over.
What happens then is even trickier to predict but some even more extraordinary scenarios have already been discussed.
Just one example came from former Conservative leadership candidate Rory Stewart.
Stewart has threatened to“sit across the road” in an alternative parliamentshould Johnsonsucceed in “locking the doors of parliament”to force Brexit through.
It’s another once inconceivable prospect that suddenly seems much more relevant than ever before.

AN INTERNAL BRITISH government document has warned that a no-deal Brexit could result in “consumer panic”, “security gaps” and “law and order challenges”.
The internal document predicts what a no-deal Brexit “could look like on the ground” in the first day, fortnight and month.
A no-deal scenario seems increasingly likely – the House of Commons rejected Theresa May’s Brexit deal three times, and new Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s has insisted that Britain will leave the European Union before the current deadline of 31 October.
The document,obtained by Sky News, was written in the weeks before Johnson succeeded May.

It states that British people living in EU countries may lose access to services and resident rights, prompting them to move home; the pound Sterling would likely fall; trade would be negatively impacted; and there could be an increased risk of people smuggling.
In relation to Northern Ireland, the first day following a no-deal Brexit could see cross-border agricultural trade virtually stop and other trade slow down. Within the first month, small businesses in Northern Ireland could face “distress and potential law and order challenges”, the document notes.
Contingency plans are being made at British, Irish and European level in a bid to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.
‘We should be afraid’
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar yesterday again warned about the likelynegative implicationsof such a scenario. He said a no-deal Brexit “would have very serious impacts on the economy, north and south, and on Britain”.
“It could have security implications as well and it could have constitutional implications.

Johnson has claimed he can get a ‘better’ deal, last week stating: “The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts.
“The doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters are going to get it wrong again … We are going to come out of the EU on October 31 – no ifs, no buts. We will do a new deal, a better deal that will maximise the opportunities.”
Many Conservative and DUP politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the Withdrawal Agreement, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
European leaders have repeatedly said that the deal cannot be renegotiated.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brussels-barclay-barnier-4846706-Oct2019/,"UK BREXIT SECRETARY Stephen Barclay is holding key talks with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier today as the chance of a breakthrough on securing a withdrawal deal appear somewhat more likely.
The Brussels meeting comes in the wake ofdiscussionsbetween Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Prime Minister Boris Johnson after which both leaders declared they could “see a pathway” to a possible agreement.
Barclay’s talks look likely to give the clearest indication of whether there has been a significant thawing of relations between London and the EU after a week of abrupt exchanges.
Such a move could lead to the start of so-called intensive “tunnel” negotiations in the coming days ahead of the crunch EU heads of government summit on 17 and 18 October.
The unexpectedly cordial atmosphere of the meeting between the two leaders led to speculation of a possible compromise on the contentious issue of the Northern Ireland border backstop.
When asked about the state-of-play this morning, Varadkar said: “I think at this stage probable the less said the better.”
He said the focus today very much switches to Brussels where Barclay is meeting Barnier.

“I’d anticipate that will lead to some more detailed proposals being laid down and then the possibility for talks to enter the proverbial tunnel,” he said.

Sterling rose sharply on international money markets in the wake of the talks.
After more than two hours of “detailed and constructive” discussions at a country manor on the Wirral yesterday, the two leaders said it was in “everybody’s interest” to get an agreement which would allow the UK to leave with a deal.
Varadkar said he hoped the progress they had made would be “sufficient” to enable intensive negotiations to resume in Brussels ahead of next week’s crucial EU summit.
“I think it is possible for us to come to an agreement, to have a treaty to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, and to have that done by the end of October, but there’s many a slip between cup and lip,” he said.
“Obviously there’s a further deadline after that which is 31 of October, so I would say a short pathway rather than a long one, but it’s impossible to predict that for sure.
Varadkar refused to be drawn on any “concessions” made by either side, while UK Government sources refused to be drawn on media reports here suggesting “significant movement” by the UK.
Tory former chancellor and arch-Brexiteer Lord Norman Lamont said he wanted to know what any UK concessions were.

Hetold the BBC: “No, I am not worried. I have to know what the concessions are.
“It does look as though there is a change of mood.”
He added: “Maybe there is some change on the mechanism whereby the deal is approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.
“Maybe there will be an opting-out mechanism rather than an opting-in mechanism.”
Without a deal, Johnson will face demands from opposition parties to comply with the so-called Benn Act which would require him to request a three month Brexit delay if there is no agreement by 19 October.
The PM has said while he will abide by the law, he is determined to leave on the Halloween deadline of 31 October come what may.

WAITING, ON THE Irish backstop.
On 8 December 2017, at the tailend of phase one of moulding the Withdrawal Agreement into shape, a carefully worded short phrase was included by EU and UK negotiating teams with the aim of preventing a hard border from reappearing on the island of Ireland.
The backstop, also known as the Irish Protocol, would ensure that there would be “regulatory alignment” between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit, no matter the negotiating stances or demands either of them would make.
Avoiding a hard border is something that Ireland, the UK and the EU have all said they want to do – but it’s proved to be one of the most contentious parts of an already tense Brexit debate. It’s formed the basis formany a political columnin Ireland and the UK, and has beenpoliticised massively.
Since the freshly ‘elected’ Boris Johnson has taken the reins at 10 Downing Street, he’s called the backstop “anti-democratic”, adding to previous statements he made about it where he said it needed to be “scrapped”, and “binned”.
For Johnson to succeed in his Brexit policy, the platform upon which he became Tory leader, he needs to either get a Brexit deal without the backstop, or push for a no-deal Brexit – the only two options to get the UK out of the EU by 31 October, as he promised.
So what does this mean for the backstop – what is so unpalatable about it, and is there room for manoeuvre so we can reach a compromise?
The Protocol
European CommissionEuropean Commission
Ahead of negotiations with the UK, the EU said it was prioritising three issues, or red lines; these were a‘divorce’ settlement(or a fee for leaving the EU); securing therights of EU citizens living in the UK; andstability for Northern Ireland.
The backstop would become the solution for the third priority here.
Put simply, the backstop ensures that a hard border won’t reappear on the island of Ireland, no matter the outcome of Brexit or the subsequent trade talks between the EU and UK. The term ‘backstop’ was a sporting term originally: in cricket, it’s the person that keeps the other team from scoring; and in baseball, it’s the net that stops innocent onlookers getting injured by a long-shot. Apt.
Put slightly more complicatedly, the backstop means that Northern Ireland would stay ‘aligned’ to the regulations of the Single Market and the Customs Union if the EU and the UK cannot agree a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that would share the same customs rules by December 2020.
The EU has said it can’t discuss future trading matters with a current member state, so the UK has to leave the EU before they can discuss trade. This is what led to the Brexit ‘divorce’ deal, or the Withdrawal Agreement, which outlines the conditions upon which the UK leaves the EU.
Originally, the backstop was to apply to just Northern Ireland, and the UK would be free to put in place whatever customs and regulatory rules it wanted. But when the wording was being finalised in December 2017 the DUP, which is propping up the Tory government in Westminster, said that Northern Ireland couldn’t be treated differently to the rest of the UK (despite other societal changes already in place).
Theresa May then flew back from Brussels to London, to discuss a more acceptable wording, which would be agreed and signed off on by the end of that week. After this, the backstop would also mean that there would be “no new regulatory barriers develop (sic) between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom”.
Boris Johnson wants rid of the backstop - will he get his way?Ik AldamaIk Aldama
As it stands, the exact wordingon page 303 of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, is:
To avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland:“RECALLING the commitment of the United Kingdom to protect North-South cooperation and its guarantee of avoiding a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls, and bearing in mind that any future arrangements must be compatible with these overarching requirements”.
To avoid a border along the Irish Sea:“UNDERLINING the parties’ shared aim of avoiding, to the extent possible in accordance with applicable legislation and taking into account their respective regulatory regimes as well as their implementation, controls at the ports and airports of Northern Ireland”.
Varadkar and Coveney have been staunch defenders of the backstop.PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
These lines meet the objectives of those on both sides of the Brexit negotiating table… but this is the part that has caused the problem:
The whole of the UK being in the backstop means that they cannot strike free trade agreements with other countries, or set their own standards of customs rules and regulations – and being able to decide their own rules was a big part of the hoped-for Brexit benefits.
To avoid the backstop being needed, there would have to be the same, or very similar custom rules and regulations for products, food, animals, people and vehicles between the UK and the EU – or Northern Ireland and Ireland. If this doesn’t happen, the changes could be as dramatic astwo different time zoneson the island of Ireland.
But until talks between the EU and UK on trade begin, it won’t be clear how many regulations and customs checks will be the same or different, and because of that it isn’t clear whether the backstop is necessary.

Efforts to find compromise
Since the backstop was agreed between the EU and the UK, there have been bitter rows about whether it’s “vital”, especially as it’s been cited as the reason why Brexiteers voted against the Withdrawal Agreement in such historic numbers.
Among the compromises that have been considered to ease the concerns of Brexiteers, have been:
Should it be for a limited period of time or not?The UK side says it should be time limited, which would give them time to work out a Free Trade Deal, or if not that, give time for technological solutions that it argues would preserve a frictionless border.
The UK side has also argued that a Brexit deal with this type of backstop is better than no deal.
The EU, so far, has responded by saying it needs to be an “all-weather” backstop, and would be pointless if it were temporary.
If the backstop ends in five years’ time, for example, and there’s no Free Trade Deal or new technology, a hard border on the island of Ireland couldn’t be avoided.
Would it apply to the UK as a whole, or just Northern Ireland?Theresa May’s government wanted it to apply to the whole of the UK, but this has been shot down by Johnson’s government, who wants the backstop scrapped entirely.
Theresa May also said previously that if at the end of 2020, a trade agreement isn’t struck, the UK would choose between a UK-wide customs backstop or a short extension of the implementation period, which would just buy more time in trade talks.

If there’s no agreement on the backstop – as in, if the UK government won’t agree to “regulatory align” with the EU – then there is no Brexit deal and the UK will go crashing out of the EU.
Ironically, if the UK does go crashing out of the EU, it’s most likely that a hard border will automatically reappear on the island of Ireland anyway – which is something German Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted to previously.
The EU has also said it has costed erecting a variety of borders in Ireland.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar warned EU leaders and the new UK government, that if a hard border does return to the island of Ireland, it could see a return to Troubles-era violence.
Theresa May and her colleagues sit with Arlene Foster and the Tory leadership, June 2017.PA Archive / PA ImagesPA Archive / PA Images / PA Images
From the outside, it seems as though both the EU and UK thought that the other side’s stance on the backstop would soften.
Theresa May repeatedly said that she wouldn’t accept a deal that would “carve off” Northern Ireland from Great Britain, and that she would preserve the integrity of the United Kingdom.
Barnier tried to “de-dramatise” the idea of customs checks under a Northern Ireland-only backstop, saying that it would simply increase the number of goods and vehicles checked at ports and airports.
Theresa May’s stance on the backstop softened as she ran out of options to get her Brexit deal through parliament, and ended up with the UK-wide customs deal that we currently know as the backstop, which has been voted down by the British parliament.
(Even if it was removed from the Withdrawal Agreement,it doesn’t look likethe House of Commons would pass it.)
Alternative arrangements, and technological solutions to solve the border issue have been suggested as a way of making the backstop unnecessary – but an internal document at the Home Office previously suggested that the technology needed to avoid the UK adopting the EU’s rules, wouldn’t be in place until 2030.
Added to that, any technological solutions to avoid a hard border would involve some sort of hardware, which could be targeted by dissidents as a symbol of a divide in Ireland.
So, the backstop has become a symbol of the scale of the division between Brexiteers and the EU – for some in the UK it represents unnecessary bureaucracy that prevents people from “getting on with it”, while to the EU, it represents a safety net for peace in one of its regions.
And that divide might lead us to a no-deal Brexit in three months’ time.

BORIS JOHNSON IS having a bad week.
Just 24 hours after the Supreme Courtruledthat his prorogation was “unlawful, void and had no effect”, he’s now had to cut his trip to the UN summit in New York short to attend a verbal bashing from his revived parliament this afternoon.
Amidst calls for him to resign from the opposition, Johnson’s team is also in the firing line: Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg is coming under criticism for not representing parliament properly at Cabinet; attorney general Geoffrey Cox’s advice to Johnson is also under scrutiny; and the Prime Minister’s main adviser Dominic Cummings is also being told to step aside, as prorogation is understood to be his idea.
Johnson will speak later but the afternoon featured a number of angry exchanges involving the aforementioned Cox in the House of Commons

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-arlene-foster-brexit-4815054-Sep2019/,"DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster has indicated for the first time that she may be open to a Brexit solution that would involve special arrangements for the North.
Speaking to journalists in Dublin this evening, Foster suggested that a new Brexit deal in which the North was treated differently to the rest of the UK could be palatable to her party.
According to The Irish Times, Foster said she “hoped” solutions specific to the North would be possible if they did not affect the constitutional position of the region.
“I think what we want to see is a recognition that we are on an island, we do recognise the unique history and geography, but we also have to recognise that we are in the United Kingdom,” she is reported to have said.
The DUP leader was speaking ahead of an address to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce in central Dublin.

During her speech, Foster said she recognised that many in Ireland were shocked at the outcome of the 2016 Brexit referendum, and that they feared for the future about what a new relationship with the UK would entail.
But she added:
Nevertheless, she said that a no-deal Brexit was not the preferred outcome, and that her party wanted to see an agreement reached which worked for Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the other EU member states.
She described the backstop as “anti-democratic” and “unconstitutional”, reiterating that it was her party’s position that it should be removed from the UK’s withdrawal agreement.
“We are clear that the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, must leave the EU customs union and the single market,” she said.
“Both the UK-wide and the Northern Ireland specific backstop were designed so that Northern Ireland would remain as part of the EU customs code.
“The concept that there could ever be customs duties falling due within the internal market of the United Kingdom following departure from the European Union is one we could never support.”

The British prime minister’s office called the leak “unacceptable” but also defended the work of ambassadors in providing “honest, unvarnished assessments of politics in their country.”
“The prime minister has full faith in her ambassador to Washington,” a Downing Street spokesperson said.
“The good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new Prime Minister,” Trump wrote tonight.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-and-wage-increase-lead-to-drop-in-confidence-for-irelands-small-businesses-4708249-Jul2019/,"CONFIDENCE AMONG IRELAND’S small businesses has dropped significantly, according to a new survey published today.
The Small Firms Association (SFA) has revealed that only 45% its members feel that the business environment is improving compared with 59% in November 2018.
In a first for the SFA survey, the large drop in sentiment comes as a result of Brexit uncertainty, increasing tax and wage inflation.
SFA Director Sven Spollen-Behrens toldTheJournal.iethat today’s survey – to which 250 small business responded – highlights the need for Ireland’s government to conduct an assessment of Ireland’s small businesses sector.
“There is no clear playbook when it comes to Ireland’s small business sector,” he said.
Although half of those who took part in the survey said they planned to recruit employees over the coming year, capacity constraints in the labour market could challenge their plans to do that, according to Spollen-Behrens.

“In order to fill vacancies and retain employees, where the performance of the business and the individual allows, survey respondents expect wage rates to increase over the coming months.”
According to the survey, domestic economic growth and new products provide the biggest opportunity for Ireland’s small businesses.
Economic stagnation at home here in Ireland as well as ongoing uncertainty around Brexit are identified as the biggest risks to the country’s small business community.
As Tory leadership candidates Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt battle it out to be the next British Prime Minister, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said there is “enormous hostility” towards the UK from EU members over the prospect of any future extensions to Brexit.
The EU has repeatedly said the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened with Johnson saying Britain would leave the EU “do or die” by 31 October.
The SFA is now calling for a national Small Business Strategy to improve small business performance in Ireland.
In the long-run, Spollen-Behrens has said that “wage increases will only be sustainable if we manage to reduce business costs or improve productivity among small business.
“Therefore, we need to boost confidence amongst our small business owners and make it easier for them to compete.”

The minister confirmed the date of Budget 2020 to reporters today, outlining that next week he will present the Summer Economic Statement.
The statement, presented every June, sets out economic predictions for the country in the run up to the Budget in October.
Two different scenarios will be set out in the statement – one for Ireland if there is a no-deal Brexit, and one in which a deal is agreed.
“There will be two different scenarios set out in the Summer Economic Statement and government will have to make a decision later in the year and I will make a recommendation as to what is the best scenario,” he said.

Due to Budget day happening just a couple of weeks ahead of the scheduled date for Brexit (31 October) the finance minister will have to predict what Westminster will do.
“We will have to form a judgement as to what to be the most likely scenario,” he told reporters today.
Despite the “challenging policy scenario” in not knowing what the UK will do, the is not making plans to have an emergency or supplementary budget after Brexit.
“I am not planning to bring out another budget,” he said.
“I will be ensuring we produce a budget which is in line with our commitments that we have with the European Union and the timings in line with every other budget that I have done. What I will be doing in the Summer Economic Statement which I will be doing next week, will be outlining different economic scenarios against which Budget 2020 will be formed,” added the minister.
“So we will be looking at the kind of economic scenario the country could face if we were to be in a deal scenario or a continuation of the status quo. What I will also be outlining is if a disorderly Brexit to occur, what then would the backdrop be for us in the preparation of a budget,” said Donohoe.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bord-bia-brexit-barometer-2-4699428-Jun2019/,"
THE IRISH FOOD and Drink industry is accelerating its preparations for Brexit amid the return to prominence of a ‘cliff edge’ no deal Brexit scenario, according to the latest Brexit Barometer from Bord Bia.
The Barometer is put together using data collected from 130 Irish food, drink and horticulture companies between April 1 and May 17 2019.
Over the past year, the food board noted what it called a “transformation in levels of preparedness”. This was largely driven by the expectation for much of 2018 that an agreement was finally in sight combined with the return of the possibility of a no-deal Brexit when it became clear that this agreement would not be concluded.
“It was an experience that left Irish exporters in no doubt that their future trading relationship with UK customers needed to be addressed sooner rather than later,” Tara McCarthy, the chief executive of Bord Bia, said in the report.
The survey is in its third year. In 2018, 20% of respondents said that they had made “clear progress” in their preparations for Brexit while this year, that figure rose to 65%.
Despite the uncertainty around Brexit, food and drink exports to the UK from Ireland hit a record €4.5 billion. Britain accounted for 37% of all Irish food and drink exports last year.
Stockholding
With unpredictability looming large, 68% of companies surveyed said they were uncertain of the impact Brexit would have on their businesses.
As a result, 70% of Irish companies are preparing contingency options for holding stock in the case of a no-deal Brexit – double the figure of last year.
While alcohol, dairy and prepared consumer foods – like ready-meals – are particularly active on this front, the more perishable horticulture sector is the most exposed.
Advertisement
Many companies are also holding stock in other European countries – in case of issues with the UK landbridge.
More than half of companies surveyed are holding up to three weeks of stock, while 14% are holding 12 weeks or more, as contingency measures.
Launching the report earlier this week, Food Minister Michael Creed said:
Coming up to the current October Brexit deadline, stockholding will become more complicated logistically due to storage being at full capacity and the beginning of the busy Christmas period.
The food board warned that ”additional time to prepare should not be wasted”.
Supply chain
Despite increased preparedness, companies are growing more concerned with the cost of customs compliance and stockholding. Another concern is potential weak links in supply chains.
More than 20% of those surveyed said they have changed their raw material and input sourcing away from the UK – largely to within the EU – as a result of Brexit.
However, in some cases changing sources is not an option.
Just under three quarters of respondents are actively seeking to diversity into new markets.

https://www.thejournal.ie/corbyn-brexit-no-deal-4788141-Aug2019/,"UK LABOUR LEADER Jeremy Corbyn has said he will attempt to stop the proroguing of the British parliament through political means and added that he wants to stop a no-deal Brexit.
Speaking in Dunfermline, Scotland, Corbyn said that to prorogue parliament, effectively suspending proceedings, was effectively an attempt by Boris Johnson to carry out a “smash and grab” against British democracy.
MPs return to the Commons next Tuesday, and speaking to Sky News this evening Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said parliament will “legislate rapidly” to stop the suspension and avert a no-deal Brexit.
“What we’re going to do is try to politically stop him on Tuesday with a parliamentary process in order to legislate to prevent a no-deal Brexit and also to try and prevent him shutting down parliament during this utterly crucial period,” he said.
Johnson announced yesterday that he had spoken to the Queen about suspending parliament from the second week in September until 14 October, less than two weeks before the UK is set to leave the European Union.

The move limits the time available to opposition MPs hoping to pass new laws that could prevent a no-deal Brexit before 31 October.
Speaking today, Corbyn said that Labour will attempt to stop this suspension.
He said: “We will be back in parliament on Tuesday to challenge Boris Johnson on what I think is a smash and grab raid against our democracy,” Mr Corbyn said.
“He’s trying to suspend parliament in order to prevent a serious discussion and a serious debate to prevent a no-deal Brexit.
“The implications for this country are very, very serious.”
In the wake of yesterday’s developmentsa group of politicians haveasked a court in Scotland to block Johnson’s bid to suspend parliament. A legal bid has also been launched inBelfast in a bid to stop the suspension.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-2-4792740-Sep2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said that there are “no circumstances” in which he will seek another Brexit delay from the EU, adding that he does not want a general election.
Speaking outside Downing Street this evening after he had called his ministers to an unplanned meeting of cabinet, Johnson said that the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 October “no ifs, no buts”.
The speech comes as Labour’s Hilary Benn MP tabled a bill that seeks to force the UK government to extend the Brexit deadline and seek a new agreement with the EU.
It also seeks to prevent a no-deal Brexit by requiring parliament’s consent to leave without a deal.
Speaking this evening, Johnson sought to discourage MPs from supporting this and other similar legislation.

“MPs should vote with the government against Corbyn’s pointless delay,” Johnson said.
“And armed and fortified with that conviction, I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October. A deal that parliament will certainly be able to scrutinise.
“And in the meantime let’s let our negotiators get on with their work without that Sword of Damocles over their necks and without an election. I don’t want an election, you don’t want an election. Let’s get on with the people’s agenda,” he added.
Johnson’s decision to hold a cabinet meeting and a Downing Street statement led to speculation that the UK is moving closer to a general election.
If Johnson was to seek a general election, he would require the support of two-thirds of the House of Commons due to the UK’s Fixed-term Parliaments Act.

https://www.thejournal.ie/coveney-brexit-barclay-barnier-brussels-4817136-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Sep 2019
BREXIT TALKS ARE progressing with ”momentum”, the British minister in charge of the divorce said today after meeting his EU counterpart, despite warnings that a deal was still some way off.
After talks in Brussels with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay said there was a “shared sense of purpose” to reach agreement and avoid Britain crashing out of the bloc without a divorce agreement.
Britain is racing toward its 31 October departure without an exit agreement and faces the threat of economic disruption that the government admits could cause food shortages and spark civil unrest.
Barclay and Barnier discussed three papers submitted by London with ideas on replacing the so-called ‘backstop’ provisions in the Brexit deal struck last year but rejected by British lawmakers.
“There is significant work still to do but there are serious discussions that are taking place,” Barclay said after the talks.
However, the European Commission, which leads Brexit talks for the remaining 27 member states, gave a more sober assessment, stressing that the British papers amounted to no more than “a first set of concepts, principles and ideas”.
“It is essential that there is a fully workable and legally operational solution included in the withdrawal agreement,” the commission said.
“We remain willing and open to examine any such proposals that meet all the objectives of the backstop.”

This meeting comes after Tánaiste Simon Coveney said that Ireland is aware of the consequences of a no-deal but it won’t be “collateral damage” to any Brexit deal.
Speaking toBBC Radio 4′s Todayprogramme, Coveney said: “The Irish position is that we want to find a solution, we want to get a deal, and we want to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly and sensible manner but we cannot let Ireland be the collateral damage of that.
Coveney was responding to comments made by Barclay, who had suggested that the alternative solution to the backstop may not be needed until the end of 2020.

Meanwhile, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Junker said yesterday that Brussels could drop the so-called “backstop” solution for Northern Ireland if Britain came up with afail-safe alternative.
“If the objectives are met – all of them – we don’t need the backstop,” Juncker told Sky News.
Brussels has rejected London’s past suggestions for the Irish border issue and has called for a clear alternative well before Johnson attends a potentially decisive EU summit in Brussels on October 17-18.

Papers
The British government spokesman said London has submitted “a series of confidential technical non-papers” with its thoughts on the dispute. Technical “non-papers” are documents used in negotiations that do not represent a formal position.
But EU Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva refused to call the papers an official written proposal.
“There are papers for now, until we have looked at them in detail, I will not characterise them beyond being papers,” she told reporters in Brussels yesterday.
Juncker said Brussels had received them late Wednesday and that he had not had a chance to read them through.
Coveney told the BBC this morning that “there’s certainly a lot of commentary now and some of it is spin in the context of where we are” with Brexit.
“Asking to remove a very significant section within the withdrawal agreement that solves many of the Irish issues, without any serious proposals as to how you solve those problems, is not going to be the basis of an agreement.
“That is why I think there is an onus on the British government to come forward with alternative arrangements if they have them, that can resolve the Irish border problem,” he said.
He reiterated his warning that a no-deal would be “very damaging” for Ireland, adding “it’s very difficult, and it poses huge questions for politics and potentially for the management of civic unrest in the context of Northern Ireland around the border”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/four-brexit-scenarios-4808978-Sep2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON’S PREMIERSHIP hasn’t changed anything so far when it comes to Brexit.
With the make-up of the House of Commons the way it is, it’s impossible to imagine any Brexit deal that would break the current impasse, backstop or not.
So what’s next?
Despite the two motions tabled by Boris Johnson failing to get the votes it needed to trigger an election, this still appears the most likely outcome – it’s a matter of the opposition waiting for the best moment to allow an election.
Under British law, the next election is not due until 2022 and a two-thirds parliamentary majority is required (that’s 434 MPs) if the government wants to hold a vote before that.
Labour abstained on Johnson’s first vote on a snap election date of 15 October, saying parliament should first approve a draft law aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit, which has now been done.
The party then also rejected a second vote, after internal wrangling between election-eager Labour leader Corbyn with some other top figures within the party who felt they should hold off for even longer.
The reason for the rejection – no deal legislation aside – is that opposition MPs fear that Johnson won’t keep his promise to hold the election on 15 October and warn he may try to delay it until after the Brexit deadline on 31 October. That level of mistrust is a good example of the exact difficulties Johnson will have in getting any possible Brexit deal through the House of Commons.
This may also not be a good time for an election for Labour, which is languishing in the opinion polls. A recentYouGov voting intentionsurvey put the Conservatives down from 35% last week to 32% this week, and Labour from 25% to 23%.
The Lib Dem vote is up from 16% last week to 19% now, and the Brexit Party experienced the same growth: up three points to 14%.
If Labour remains opposed, Johnson could consider other options, such as calling a vote of no-confidence in his own government or introducing a different type of law for an election, both of which only require a simple majority.
Johnson could also resign, which would be another way to trigger a general election. It’s been said that if this did happen, Corbyn could go to the queen to ask for permission to form a government with him as its ‘caretaker’ PM until a general election is held.
As parliament is prorogued until 14 October, it will be the middle of November at the earliest before we have an election otherwise, as there must be at least 25 working days between when a general election is called and when it happens.
No-deal Brexit
The UK is legally due to leave the European Union on 31 October whether it has agreed a Brexit deal with Brussels or not.

Johnson insists he will not make any more requests to delay Brexit, as it’s been more than three years after British citizens voted to leave the bloc in June 2016. It’s also been reported that other EU nations would be reluctant to acquiesce to another extension request, after the first two bore no fruit (as of yet).
Although Johnson says he wants a deal, he has stepped up preparations for a no-deal exit (which, he has repeatedly argued, will help them to get a deal).
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has argued that the UK would have to return to negotiations in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as some sort of relationship would have to be built between the EU and the UK eventually. So negotiations don’t necessarily end there.
Johnson was accused of suspending the British parliament for five weeks in an attempt to force through a no-deal Brexit behind MPs’ backs. It’s possible that other efforts similar to this will be made by his government in order to make Brexit happen.
A Brexit deal
Boris Johnson has said repeatedly that he wants a Brexit deal. More specifically, he wants to renegotiate the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement agreed by his predecessor Theresa May, which was rejected three times by the UK parliament.
Johnson says that his main objection to the Withdrawal plan is the backstop – a mechanism for keeping an open, friction-less border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in the even that no other solution to do this is found.
The EU and Ireland have remained insistent that the backstop provision must stay, and that it’s up to London to come up with any credible alternative – although Johnson said he has an “abundance of proposals” duringhis Dublin visit, he didn’t share publicly.
Johnson is pinning his hopes on a 17-18 October EU summit when he believes the threat of a no-deal Brexit will prompt the bloc to make compromises and allow a last-minute agreement. That being said, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has recently saidthere’s “no reason to be optimistic” that a Brexit deal will be done.
Alternatively, some believe May’s divorce deal could be presented to MPs again. If the Withdrawal Agreement is put to MPs once more, it has a more likely chance of passing – with each vote on the deal, the majority it has been defeated by has decreased.
In the event that the Withdrawal Agreement is passed by MPs, it’s possible that a referendum will be held to ask the people should the UK leave under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, or should it remain in the EU and revoke Article 50.
The Hilary Benn bill, which is now law, instructs the government to seek to push back the Brexit deadline until 31 January 2020 at the earliest, if it has not reached an EU deal by 19 October – which is after the EU summit.
Ultimately, that decision rests with the 28 EU leaders. The Irish government has said that it would be in favour of another Brexit extension – anything to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border – but has raised concerns that others might not be willing to drag the Brexit timeline out further.
The Benn law says that if a delay is agreed, then the UK government must regularly report to parliament on its progress in negotiations, and if there is still no deal by 31 January, it implies that Brexit would have to be delayed again.
Johnson has warned that the legislation could have the effect of delaying Brexit “potentially for years”, and has said he’d rather be “dead in a ditch” than to ask the EU to grant the UK more time to pass a Brexit deal.
Finally, if there is a Brexit extension, it’s possible that Brexit won’t happen at all – that’s a theory supported by many observers, includingthe man who first used the term Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has promised that if he wins power, he will hold a second referendum with an option to remain in the European Union.
It’s both not really a Brexit scenario and unlikely to happen.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-leo-varadakr-new-york-4823507-Sep2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has met with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson today in New York.
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the Taoiseach described the meeting as “good” stating that they were able to get into “more detail” on the withdrawal agreement and the Irish backstop than in their previous meeting in Dublin.
However, Varadkar added that there is still a “very wide gap” that needs to be closed in terms to what the UK is proposing and what the EU wants to achieve.
The Taoiseach said they were keen that a deal be reached, stating that it is in Ireland’s and Britain’s interests that an orderly Brexit be achieved.
Johnson said he is “cautiously optimistic” that a Brexit deal can be reached, but added that there is a “short time” to achieve it.
Varadkar added that there are “certain guarantees” that the UK agreed to in 2017 that must be honoured.

The meeting comes after this morning’sUK Supreme Court rulingwhich found that the prorogation order to suspend parliament was “unlawful, void and had no effect” and should be quashed – meaning that in law parliament has not been prorogued.
The judges ruled that Johnson’s advice to Queen Elizabeth II to suspend parliament for five weeks until 14 October was illegal.
MPs are now due to return tomorrow.
When asked if the Supreme Court ruling was discussed during the meeting, Varadkar said:
“No, not in any detail.”
He added that any decision made by the Supreme Court in the UK “is not something we are going to get involved in”.
The Taoiseach said they agreed to hold another meeting “in the near future”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-government-publishes-operation-yellowhammer-documents-4805437-Sep2019/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has published Operation Yellowhammer papers which lay out no-deal Brexit preparations and the impact of Britain leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement.
Thesix-page documentincludes warnings of delays lasting three months at Channel crossings, significant electricity price hikes and impacts on medicine and food supplies.
Scenarios include Channel crossings lasting up to three months before improving, the document notes, while lorries could face maximum delays of up to two-and-a-half days.
In addition, there could be immigration delays at the Channel Tunnel, ferry crossings and airports.
The document also warns of “significant” electricity price rises while medicine supplies will be “particularly vulnerable to severe extended delays”. Supplies of some fresh food will also likely decrease.
Meanwhile, some people havequeriedwhy Section 15 of the document has been redacted.

Much of the details contained in the documents hadalready been reportedby the Sunday Times.
The papers also contain stark details of what could happen at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
“Prices and other differentials are likely to lead to the growth of the illegitimate economy. This will be particularly severe in border communities where both criminal and dissident groups already operate with greater threat and impunity,” one section of the document states.
It also warns of major disruption across the UK if the country crashes out of the EU without a deal. “Protests and counter-protests will take place across the UK and may absorb significant amounts of police resource,” the document warns.
“There may also be a rise in public disorder and community tensions.”
It also contains warnings that “low-income groups will be disproportionately affected by any price rises in food and fuel”.
On Monday evening, British MPs backed a motion requiring the release of no-deal planning documents and documents relating to the suspension of parliament.
The motion, put forward by Dominic Grieve who lost the Conservative Party whip last week, requires the release of all internal communications, including with Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s controversial adviser Dominic Cummings.
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said in the Commons prior to the vote that he has already said that the government intends to publish a version of its Operation Yellowhammer report on no-deal planning.

But it is neither an impact assessment or a worst-case scenario, Gove added.
The government has, however, refused to release internal communications between Johnson’s top advisers over Operation Yellowhammer and parliament’s suspension.
In aletter, Gove addressed Grieve and said that the request would breach the rights of those named in the communications.
“This is an unprecedented, inappropriate, and disproportionate use of [the Humble Address] procedure. To name individuals without any regard for their rights or the consequences of doing so goes far beyond any reasonable right of Parliament under this procedure,” Gove wrote.
On Monday, parliament was suspended after Johnson failed to gain support for a motion calling for a general election.
MPs aredue backin parliament on 14 October for what’s known as the Queen’s Speech, which officially opens the House of Commons once again.
This morning, however, Scotland’s highest civil court rules that Johnson’s prorogation – suspension – of parliament wasunlawful.

https://www.thejournal.ie/truck-driver-protest-irish-border-4860026-Oct2019/,"MORE THAN 150 truck drivers have staged a protest at the Irish border in a bid to highlight the importance of free-flowing movement.
A convoy of trucks made their way from Donegal and crossed the border into Co Derry.
Truck drivers taking part said they want to show how the free movement of freight is vital to businesses and trade.
The protest was brought to a standstill at the main border route, as hundreds of drivers and their supporters turned out to “show the world” what custom checks and infrastructure would look like.
There are about 13,800 border crossings every day between the Republic and Northern Ireland.
George Mills, from the Irish Road Haulage Association, said: “We don’t have to fill out any documentation or electronics or otherwise to cross this border, which we need to do every day of the week because of where we live.
“We can’t go anywhere without crossing the border, even to do our business with Dublin.

“After Brexit, we will be crossing an EU/non-EU frontier and that’s going to create so many problems. We want to show the world how easy it is now.
“We don’t want to go back to any form of regulation that impacts that form of free movement of traffic.
“Our nearest port is Derry and Belfast, and they must bring up all our oil, coal, gas, animal feed, timber, coal. The nearest alternative is 200 miles away in Co Limerick that can handle that amount of cargo.
“If a shipload of coal comes into Derry and it’s bound for a non-EU country it could possibly be of a different grade or quality than coal coming into an EU country.
“How will they divide that coal or animal feed? It will cause a lot more problems than they realise.”
‘We don’t want to go back to those days’
Truck driver Tom Doherty said it is important to show what a hard border would look like.
Doherty, 57, who travels to Dublin every day from the Inishowen area to deliver fruit, vegetables and potatoes, said truck drivers would face “chaos” and “mayhem” at custom checks.
“I did it up to 1990 and it wasn’t nice,” he said.
Related ReadsUK will leave the EU on 31 October, says senior cabinet minister
“We don’t want to go back to those days of queuing at the border.
“We also don’t know what tariffs we will have to pay on potatoes. If I want to avoid crossing the border we have to go by Sligo, and it’s an extra three hours driving.
“Who will foot the extra cost? The farmer, customers or me?
“People don’t want a border, full stop. The younger generation don’t know what it is going to be like.”
Doherty, who has been driving trucks for 30 years, is also concerned about the impact on the number of young people who want to work in the industry.
“They’re not going to want to sit at the border for hours and I wouldn’t expect them to,” he added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/european-parliament-brexit-martina-anderson-4814057-Sep2019/,"A BREXIT DEBATE has taken place in the European Parliament, drawing statements from MEPs Nigel Farage, Guy Verhofstadt and a symbolic gesture from Sinn Féin’s Martina Anderson.
Wearing an Irish soccer jersey of midfielder James McClean, Anderson said that it was her right as an Irish-passport holder from Northern Ireland to remain as an EU citizen, despite Brexit.
There isno dress codeor restriction on messages on clothing for the European Parliament, which is different from the Dáil rules.
Her statement came after the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this morning gave MEPs an update on the progress made on Brexit.
“It is certainly not a question of pretending to negotiate,” Barnier warned.
In “this extraordinary and complex negotiation… it is our responsibility to pursue this process with determination, with sincerity”.
After meeting with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday, Juncker told MEPs: ”I said to Mr Johnson that I have no emotional attachment to the backstop, but I stand by the objectives it is intended to achieve.”

Anderson told her fellow MEPs that her Irish passport gives an entitlement to those born on the island of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation and entitled to EU citizenship.
Referencing the recentLord Ashcroft pollthat indicated that a slim majority of those in Northern Ireland would be in favour of reunification, Anderson said that it was “important” that the European Parliament recognise the “legitimacy to our right to change Northern Ireland’s status”.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage spoke directly after Anderson, and said that it was clear from “the emollient tone from Junker and Barnier that we’re actually very close to a deal on the backstop being agreed”.
He referred to a humiliation by the “pipsqueak Prime Minister of Luxembourg”.
Luxembourg’s PM Xavier Bettel conducted a press conference next to an empty lectern after Boris Johnson withdrew from it due to protests on Monday.
Bettel, who had a meeting with Johnson following the British leader’s lunch with Juncker,was scathingabout Johnson’s efforts to rewrite a withdrawal agreement the UK had struck with the EU under his predecessor Theresa May.
“Keeping us trapped inside [the EU] was Barnier’s plan,” Nigel Farage said today.
“We want no part of your European empire, we want a clean break Brexit.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt-tory-leadership-backstop-4726016-Jul2019/,"THE TWO CANDIDATES who are vying to become Britain’s next prime minister both condemned US President Donald Trump’s tweets about progressive Democrat congresswomen as “totally offensive” and “totally unacceptable”.
But front-runner Boris Johnson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt refused to call the tweets racist when pressed to do so during their last debate before next week’s announcement of who will succeed current Prime Minister Theresa May.
May’s spokesman had earlier said that the outgoing leader’s view was that Trump’s comments were “completely unacceptable”.
Trump’s doubled-down on a series of tweets from Sunday today, when he urged the four congresswomen of colour to “go back” to the countries they came from.
“If you’re not happy here, you can leave,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
Johnson said the original tweets expressed sentiments “that went out decades and decades ago”.
“I think the relations between the UK and US are incredibly important,” he said.
“But if you are the leader of a great multiracial, multicultural society, you simply cannot use that kind of language about sending people back where they came from.

“It’s totally unacceptable and I agree with the prime minister.”
Trump has developed a good relationship with Johnson and backs both his leadership bid and determination to take Britain out of EU.
Pressed by the moderator to call Trump’s tweets racist, Johnson said: “I’ve said what I said.”
Hunt recalled that he had three half-ethnically Chinese children who are British citizens.
“If anyone said to them, go back to China, I would be utterly appalled,” Hunt said. “It is totally un-British to say that.”
Pressed to call the comments racist, Hunt signalled that he would have were he not Britain’s chief diplomat.
“Look, I am foreign secretary, this is the president of a country which happens to be our closest ally and so it is not gonna help the situation to use that kind of language about the president of the United States,” Hunt said.
“I can understand how many people of this country would want me to use those words, and would feel that sentiment,” he added.
“But I hope I have made absolutely clear how totally offensive it is to me that people are still saying that kind of thing.”
The winner of the ballot will be announced on 23 July. The new prime minister formally assumes office the following day.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-week-in-quotes-supreme-court-4823980-Sep2019/,"WORDS MATTER, PARTICULARLY this week that became historic for what was and wasn’t said.
In what was the most crucial news of the week, the President of the UK Supreme Court Lady Hale gave a historic judgement in a clear non-legal language delivery.
“…The Prime Minister’s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect,” she told the court on Tuesday.
“This means that when the Royal Commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in witha blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.”
In explaining the unanimous verdict, Hale said that the government didn’t tell the court why parliament was prorogued for five weeks:
“This was not a normal prorogation in the run-up to a Queen’s Speech.”

Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in New York for a UN summit dominated by the topic of climate change. As leaders addressed the global gathering one-by-one, Johnson’s address was erratic, confusing, and made just one off-the-cuff reference to Brexit.
In what is best described asthrashing around verbally, Johnson mused whether the Internet of Things meant that “your mattress will monitor your nightmares“, asked whether synthetic biology would “bring terrifying limbless chickens to our tables”, and referred to “pink-eyed terminators” (we’re fairly sure he meant ‘red’).
His more terrifying, bizarre reference was to the Classics, of course: “It is a trope as old as literature, that any scientific advance is punished by the gods.”
Cue the laughter.

When Johnson did react to the ruling, he had to tread carefully: stand his ground on his decision, without casting aspersions on the judiciary of his country.
“I strongly disagree with this decision of the Supreme Court. I have the utmost respect for our judiciary… I don’t think this was the right decision I think that the prorogation has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge.”
He added that “… of course parliament will come back,” much to the delight of House Speaker John Bercow who announced the return of parliament on Wednesday at 11.30.
“Colleagues, welcome back to our place of work,” he said to his fellow MPs at that time.
Elsewhere, the fallout from the Supreme Court ruling was fierce.

Amidst the Labour party’s fractured party conference in Brighton, its leader Jeremy Corbyn latched on to the opportunity to shout about something all his members could get behind: “I invite Boris Johnson – in the historic words –to consider his position, and become the shortest serving Prime Minister there’s ever been.”
I’d say that the second part of that statement gives you an answer on the first part.
To hammer home that idea that the Supreme Court ruling isn’t about Brexit, but about prorogation, Brexit Party founder and leader Nigel Faragesaid: “The calling of a Queen’s Speech and prorogation isthe worst political decision ever. Dominic Cummings must go.”
Cummings,Boris Johnson’s controversial main adviser and a former director of Vote Leave, is enjoying himself it seems.
“We are enjoying this, we are going to leave and we are going to win,”he said this week.
In response to questions from a Labour MP who demanded answers from Cummings on the divisive rhetoric made by the in the House of Commons this weekend, he calmly responded:“Get Brexit done.”
That divisive rhetoric mostly came from the Prime Minister himself and his baritone Attorney General Geoffrey Cox. Both had come under pressure over the legal advice upon which prorogation was based on from incensed MPs.
After being questioned, Cox told MPs that “at all times, the government acted in good faith”, and added:
Although it’s unusual for Attorney Generals to share their advice to the government publically, this has happened before whenCox published an abridged version of his advice on the backstop, famously saying that it would “endure indefinitely”.
Other famous orations by the Disney-villain like Cox include:
“This parliament is a dead parliament– it has no moral right to sit on these green benches… This parliament is a disgrace. Since I am asked, let me tell them the truth: they could vote no confidence at any time, but they’re too cowardly.”

He did concede on one issue: that the UK should consider writing it’s constitution down: “I do think that as we depart the EU, there is ground for thinking about our constitutional arrangements and how they should be ordered.”
About time.
When Johnsondid appear before his combative parliament, he didn’t back down: instead accusing them of “cowardice”, “humbug”, and running away from his election. He also  repeatedly used the terms ‘Surrender Act’ and ‘Capitulation Act’ when referring to the Benn Act, which would force Johnson to ask for an extension if there’s no Brexit deal.
But as he and his government were repeatedly asked to tone down his divisive inflammatory rhetoric –with Tracy Brabin, who succeeded Cox in her former constituency, saying that members should “feel secure when we’re going about our jobs”.
While Johnson’s own family called his comments“tasteless”, his Cabinet colleagues rallied around him to defend him.
The Duchy of Lancaster Michael Govesaid: ”I think it is only fair to say that Boris is the Pep Guardiola of British politics.”
Meanwhile, the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told reporters yesterday ahead of a meeting with the UK’s Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay on alternatives to the backstop: ”We are still waiting.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-brexit-house-of-commons-boris-mps-eu-deal-ulster-4856359-Oct2019/,"THE DUP HAS re-iterated that it will not vote for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, with leader Arlene Foster saying that the current agreement is “without support in unionism”.
Attention has focused on the party ahead of tomorrow’s unusual Saturday sitting of the House of Commons, when Johnson will present his deal to MPs for approval.
The party, which has 10 MPs, yesterday said that itrejected the dealreached after intense negotiations between the UK and the EU.
The party’s stance makes it much harder for Johnson, who does not have a majority in parliament, to pass his deal.
Writing in the Belfast Telegraph today, Foster said: “Tomorrow our Members of Parliament will oppose the proposals. We worked intensively with the Government over recent weeks to try and reach a fair and balanced deal.”

“We were not seeking a perfect deal. It doesn’t exist. We were seeking a deal which delivered Brexit without erecting barriers to trade,” she said.
“We regret that a deal has been reached between the UK and the EU that we cannot support. We do not believe it is in the best economic interests of Northern Ireland,” Foster added.
Under the deal, customs and regulatory arrangementswould be reviewedby Stormont every four years, beginning four years after the end of the transition period.
The Northern Ireland Assembly will vote to decide whether to continue or not with the customs and regulatory arrangements. It’s been suggested that the winner of this vote will be decided by a simple majority.
Alternatively, cross-community consent for the arrangements – that is, if the vote is passed by most nationalists and most unionists – means they would remain in place for eight years.
The voting system was changed to prevent the DUP using the petition of concern to force the North into a closer arrangement with the rest of the UK.
Speaking on the BBC Radio 4′s Today programme, DUP MP Sammy Wilson confirmed that his party would be voting against, as opposed to simply abstaining, on the deal.

“We will not be voting for the deal tomorrow when it comes before the House of Commons. Why would we, when this deal goes against everything the government promised they would not do to Northern Ireland?” he said.
Wilson said that the change to the voting system “overturned” the safeguards of the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP will be encouraging Tory MPs to vote down the deal.
“We always knew that Boris would be putting the interests of his own party first. He has made a judgement, I think wrongly, that a deal at any price with the EU is important to meet his 31 October deadline. So we were always prepared for this moment,” Wilson said.
The DUP MP said that his party had already made compromises to help Johnson secure a deal.
The party had surprised many by last week conceding to a regulatory border in the Irish sea – for the last two years treated as a“blood red line”by the party.
“Voting this down tomorrow is not the end of the game. But in fact it probably opens up possibilities for the government, which are not available at present, after a general election,” Wilson said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-5-4853138-Oct2019/,"LAST UPDATE|16 Oct 2019
EU COUNCIL PRESIDENT Donald Tusk has said that although the EU and UK had been close to a deal, there are now “certain doubts”.
“Yesterday evening I was ready to bet that it’s all set and agreed, today there are certain doubts on the British side. We’ll see, I’m still hopeful,” he said while speaking to Polish journalists in Brussels.
“I had hoped that we would have received a ready, negotiated, legal text this morning so that member states could get to know it,” Tusk said, adding that “everything is going in a good direction.”
Tusk added that we should know whether there’s a deal or not “theoretically, in seven or eight hours” via a live broadcast on Poland’s TVN24 news channel.
Tusk claimed that there was “a great deal of turmoil” on the British side, adding:
Varadkar’s assessment
Earlier today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar insisted there is “a pathway” to a Brexit deal that could see it being ratified by EU leaders tomorrow, but that “many issues” remain.
Varadkar said that he spoke to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson again this morning and that progress is being made but that “there are issues yet to be resolved”.
EU and UK negotiators are currently involved in frantic negotiations in an effort to have the text of an agreement ready for an EU Council meeting tomorrow.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and British Brexit minister Stephen Barclay judged that a deal was close enough to justify officials working overnight to draw up a withdrawal treaty text on the eve of the EU summit.
Barnier said a text must be on the table by early today if member state governments are to have a chance to consider it before the summit, as the 28 national leaders have no plans to debate the details of the agreement.
If the deadline is missed early today, officials said talks could instead resume next week and a special summit be called just in time for Johnson to fulfil his pledge to lead Britain out of the bloc on 31 October.
Meanwhile, the Dáil and Seanad passed the Health and Childcare Support Bill 2019, which provides for health benefits similar to the European Health Insurance Card to eligible residents of Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The main part of the Bill (Part 2) will enable eligible residents of Northern Ireland to be reimbursed by Ireland for the cost of medical care incurred while abroad in an EU or EEA member state, or Switzerland.

Part 3 of the Bill provides for an amendment to the Childcare Support Act 2018 to make explicit provision for British citizens to access the National Childcare Scheme on the same basis as Irish citizens.
Deal possible?
Speaking to an agri-food policy debate in the Aviva Stadium this morning, Varadkar said that a deal is possible this week.
“I am convinced that all parties are convinced about getting an agreement this week, or at least if not this week then by the end of the month. And an agreement, an orderly Brexit, however you want to describe it, is very much in the interests of Ireland, the UK and EU as a whole,” he said.
The House of Common will sit on a weekend this Saturday for the first time in almost four decades in the hope that MPs will have a deal to consider.

In London, Johnson faces a race against the clock to secure a Brexit deal and get Tory Eurosceptics and the DUP onside to back him.
Johnson carried out a charm offensive in Downing Street yesterday evening as he held a series of talks with backbenchers and the leaders of the DUP.
Meanwhile, his negotiating team worked through the night as reports increased that a deal was nearing, with a solution said to be forthcoming on the Irish border.
Johnson knows he must have members of the European Research Group (ERG), a band of hardline Tory Eurosceptics, on board or his deal has little chance of making it through a vote in the House of Commons.
It was his predecessor Theresa May’s failure to secure the ERG’s support that led to her Withdrawal Agreement being defeated three times.
But, despite a flurry of meetings at Number 10, there were reports that  Johnson’s exit terms were causing splits in the ERG.
Chair Steve Baker MP, speaking outside Downing Street, said he was “optimistic” that Mr Johnson’s team in Brussels would finalise a “tolerable deal that I will be able to vote for”.
Mark Francois said the meeting was “interesting” and added “there’ll be further chats to have”, while former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith also emerged from Downing Street.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons and a former ERG chair, told LBC: “I think the votes are there now for a deal.”

While still in office, May said such an arrangement could never be accepted by a British prime minister.
The DUP, in a statement after their second audience with the PM in as many days, were also decidedly lukewarm on the mooted proposals.
“We respect the fact negotiations are ongoing and therefore cannot give a detailed commentary but it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required,” a spokesman said.
Leader Arlene Foster and her deputy Nigel Dodds slipped out of the back exit of Downing Street and avoided waiting journalists following the meeting.
Number 10 officials were privately playing down suggestions of a Brussels breakthrough and the PM’s decision to hold Cabinet in the late afternoon indicated that negotiators still require time to finalise a deal before tomorrow’s crunch European Council summit.
If the deadline to provide a draft to EU leaders is missed early today, officials said talks could instead resume next week and a special summit be called just in time for Johnson to fulfil his pledge to lead Britain out of the bloc on 31 October.
European leaders warn they will not let the UK use Northern Ireland as a back door to the single market and Barnier said yesterday that “it is high time to turn good intentions into legal text.”
French President Emmanuel Macron apparently shared the guarded optimism, with an aide telling reporters there was “positive momentum” behind the talks.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel outlined why EU officials are driving a hard bargain and hoping Britain will commit to a “level playing field” in post-Brexit trade and commerce.
“One thing is clear, Britain will develop into another competitor on the doorstep of Europe,” Merkel told German industrialists last night.

https://www.thejournal.ie/house-prices-ireland-q3-2019-brexit-4818848-Sep2019/,"GROWTH IN HOUSING prices has slowed to just 0.1%,according to the latest report by property website Daft.ie.
However, it is not yet clear whether weakening demand due to Brexit or an increase in supply is the cause.
The average cost of a house nationwide in the third quarter of this year was €257,000.
This is still 30% lower than peak house prices in 2007, but represents an increase of 57% from the housing market’s lowest point in 2013.
The report, which bases its analysis on data from properties posted on Daft.ie, found that annual house price inflation fell into negative territory in Dublin and is now 0.6% lower than at the same time in 2018.

Inflation also remained negative in Leinster (-1%) and Connacht-Ulster (-0.6%), but is positive in Munster (2.5%) and all major cities (3% in Cork and Galway, and 5% in Limerick and Waterford).
Ronan Lyons, economist at Trinity College Dublin and author of the report, said the figures will spark debate on whether the falling house prices in some areas are due to weakening demand led by Brexit or strengthening supply.
“Price falls are concentrated in the Greater Dublin Area,” Lyons said, “and, within that, in the most expensive markets.”
“These are the areas least exposed to Brexit and where new supply has been concentrated.
The number of properties available nationwide remains largely uncharged, but regional differences – increases in Dublin and Leinster and decreases elsewhere.

https://www.thejournal.ie/john-major-boris-johnson-brexit-agreement-4826756-Sep2019/,"JOHN MAJOR HAS accused Boris Johnson of “wilfully” destroying the prospects of cross-agreement on Brexit with his Commons onslaught on the opposition.
The former prime minister said Johnson was whipping up “fear and anger” for electoral purposes – a tactic he described as “profoundly un-Conservative”.
In a speech to the Centre for European Reform, he said the Tories were acting as a “Brexit Party tribute band” and that no previous government would have behaved in such a “reckless and divisive” manner.
Major said Johnson had only “lip service” to the Supreme Court ruling that the prorogation of Parliament had been unlawful and warned he could try to circumvent the law designed to prevent a no-deal break.
He said he feared the government could try to bypass the so-called Benn Act by an executive Order in Council, suspending it until after 31 October when the UK is set to leave the EU.
“I should warn the Prime Minister that – if this route is taken – it will be in flagrant defiance of Parliament and utterly disrespectful to the Supreme Court,” he said.
Major said he increasingly feared the country was heading for a no-deal Brexit, and that any new deal with Brussels was likely to be “flimsy and partial”.
He said the Prime Minister had “wilfully destroyed any hope of cross-party agreement” with his attack in the Commons yesterday.
At the same time, he warned that a general election – which Johnson is pressing for – would not achieve anything unless the Brexit issue had been resolved first.

“To reinforce their electoral appeal, the government seems intent on whipping up dissent by using highly emotional and evocative language that can only provoke fear and anger, and fuel grievances against Parliament and the law,” he said.
“It means this government wishes to win re-election, by inciting opposition to the most important bulwarks of our state and its freedom.
“I cannot believe any previous government – in our long history – would have even considered such reckless and divisive behaviour.”
Major said that Johnson’s negotiating strategy appeared to be driven by a desire to win the support of the “anti-European hard right” of the Tory Party.
“It was always likely to be a fruitless task,” he said.
“They were appeased too much; for too long; and by too many. But they held to their convictions and spread them – often without reason and beyond scruple.
“Their opposition has made a deal almost impossible to obtain.”
He warned that such tactics risked alienating the party’s “traditional, moderate, middle-of-the-road” supporters.
“Most Conservatives are not a Brexit Party tribute band, nor have we abandoned our core values to find compromise, seek allies, and strive for unity, rather than division and disarray,” he said.
“It is emphatically not who we are as a people. And must never be seen as so.”

Flanagan is set to propose a reduction of the separation period to two years out of the previous three – down from four out of the previous five.
In May,82% of votersin a referendum backed the removal of the separation period required for divorce from the Constitution, enabling it to be changed via legislation.
The Family Law Bill 2019 also proposes reducing to one year the minimum living apart period of three years that applies to judicial separation applications in cases where the respondent does not consent to the decree of judicial separation being granted.

The proposed one-year period is in line with other minimum living apart periods for judicial separation applications.
Threat of no-deal Brexit
On 24 May, voters also supported modernising the provision on recognition of foreign divorces.
Due to “the threat” of a no-deal Brexit, a spokesperson said Flanagan is “also proposing legislation on the recognition of divorces, legal separations and annulments granted under UK law”.
“This means that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, UK decisions will be recognised by under similar rules to those granted within the EU.”
The legislation is expected to make swift progress through the Oireachtas.

Speaking at Dublin Port where he was viewing infrastructure – which has been put in place to meet the requirements for customs, SPS and health checks on consignments of goods imported from or transiting the UK – Varadkar said he didn’t think tomorrow’s meeting was a high stake one.
“I don’t think the meeting tomorrow is a high stakes meeting, as I don’t anticipate a big breakthrough tomorrow if we come to an agreement that agreement will happen in October at the EU summit. But the stakes are high, certainly, I don’t think anyone can argue with that.”
“It will be an opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better, to see if there is common ground, I’m sure there will be,” he said, adding that it would be “interesting” to see if Ireland and the UK could explore a Northern Ireland specific solution to the border issue.
“It will be interesting to see if we explore tomorrow if whether we could find common ground around a Northern Ireland specific solution, but I’ll have to judge that tomorrow,” Varadkar said.

Johnson previously said he would “rather be dead in a ditch” than seek another Brexit extension from the EU, a view the Taoiseach said he did not share.
In the event of a no-deal, Varadkar said he thinks the UK and EU would negotiate again within weeks or months but “it would be a tragedy if we got to that point”.
Checkmate
Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Ard Comhairle in Dublin yesterday Mary Lou McDonald called on the Taoiseach to refuse any checks on the island of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
She said the failure to stop checks being rolled out in Ireland amounts to “political vandalism” and would “represent a serious breach of the Good Friday Agreement”.
Earlier this week during aspeech at a British-Irish Chamber of Commerce event, Leo Varadkar said the risk of a no-deal Brexit is growing and that would mean “checks on goods and live animals,” including some near the border with Northern Ireland.
Speaking at Dublin Port today, Varadkar stressed that until details of checks on the Irish border are worked out by the European Commission, he’s not in a position to inform people yet.
When asked if he was talking weeks or months, Varadkar said: “It’s not agreed yet. It’s not worked out. The last thing I want to do now is give information that changes.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/september-dates-brexit-what-to-keep-an-eye-on-4765717-Aug2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS been unwavering in his assertion that the UK will exit the European Union – “do or die” – by the current deadline of 31 October since he entered office.
The standoff between the two sides appears intractable: Johnson and his newly minted ministers say the backstop has to go while the EU leadership continues to insist thatwon’thappen and that the thrice-rejected withdrawal deal remains the only show in town.
As far as UK politics is concerned, matters are likely to come to a head next month – with a possible no-confidence vote on the cards as early as Tuesday 3 September, when MPs return, and a potential parliamentary bid to block a no-deal expected by 9 September (the following Monday).
Another date for your Brexit calendar while we’re at it: remember the debate about the possibility prime minister Johnson could prorogue (essentially,lock the doors) of parliament to force an exit through? A legal challenge on that matter is due to be heard on Friday 6 September.
It’s expected the EU will be watching those events closely as leaders make a decision on how to proceed in the final weeks leading up to the latest cliff-edge deadline, with another summit due in mid-October.
So what what’s likely to happen over the next four weeks or so? And when?
These are the dates to keep an eye on:
It could all escalate quickly after MPs return to Westminster on this date.
Boris Johnson could face a no confidence motion tabled by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn as early as3 September–but in light of the responseto his appeal this week calling for MPs to join his effort, at this stage it looks like he’s unlikely to gain the required support.
But what’s likely to happen if that motionissuccessful? On the basis of events since the start of the year in Westminster it’s anyone’s guess – but the process it would kick off is (to say the least) a complicated one that could well result in a general election.
If Johnson loses a confidence vote he would have 14 days to prove he has the support of a majority of MPs to continue. Corbyn could attempt to secure a majority too – and a far less likely scenario could see a compromise candidate put forward to lead a new government.
At the end of the 14 days, if no grouping has a majority it’s up to the prime minister to advise the Queen when a general election will take place.
It’s speculated, however, that if no alternative government is formed Johnson could simply schedule an election for after the Brexit deadline at the end of October (and a no-deal, don’t forget, would be the default position).
Johnson’s top aide Dominic Cummings said recently that the government could do just that.

Labour’s Diane Abbott said at the start of this week that the opposition would need to move quickly once parliament returned.
And on ThursdayCorbyn made his plans clear in a letter as he urged leaders of the other opposition parties and Conservative rebels to move against Johnson and install him as a temporary prime minister.
The Labour leader said that if he won a no-confidence motion he planned to seek an extension to Article 50, after which he would attempt to call a general election (which would require a two-thirds majorityunder the Fixed-term Parliaments Act).
Labour would campaign for a second referendum in that election, Corbyn’s letter said.
The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Jo Swinson, immediately dismissed the notion of Corbyn taking over as caretaker PM (the party would prefer a cross-party administration headed up by a senior backbencher like Ken Clarke).
Four rebel and former Tory MPsresponded to Corbynto say they were open to working together towards stopping a no-deal Brexit – but Dominic Grieve, perhaps the most high-profile member of that group, said he had no intention of backing the Labour leader’s bid to enter Downing Street.
A legal challenge that would prevent Johnson from attempting to shut the doors of parliament to force through a no-deal will begin at a court in Edinburgh on this date.
More than 70 politicians, including Swinson of the Lib Dems, are backing the legal bid. They’re hoping to persuade the court that any attempt to suspend proceedings in Westminster would beunlawful and unconstitutional.
Then-candidate Johnson kicked off the controversy around the potential proroguing of parliament during the Tory leadership campaign – and has since repeatedly refused to rule it out as a measure of last resort.
Johnson has repeatedly refused to rule out suspending parliament to see Brexit through.PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
The case is to be heard initially in the Scottish courts because they sit in the summer, and the judge has fixed a full hearing for6 September.
Johnson’s refusal to rule out suspending parliament was such a controversial position during the leadership contest that one rival, Rory Stewart, went as far as to promise to set up an alternative parliament if he followed through on the move.
“If he were to try, I and every other member of parliament, will sit across the road in Methodist Central Hall and we will hold our own session of parliament,” Stewart said.
In his first public comments since Johnson took over at Number 10, meanwhile, Commons speaker John Bercow said this week he would fight an attempt to bypass parliament “with every bone in my body”.
“Nobody is going to get away as far as I am concerned” with stopping MPs taking action to avoid no-deal, Bercowtold the Telegraph.
In a process entirely separate from any potential no-confidence motion, MPs trying to block a no-deal Brexit could launch their legislative effort on or around this date.
It’s expected the cross-party group of MPs opposed to no-deal will try to take control of the Commons schedule to carve out parliamentary time for new legislation that would force the prime minister to request an extension to the Brexit deadline.

According toreports in the UK this week, government sources believe the first parliamentary bid to take control of business could happen on9 September. That’s because the government is required to allow a debate on a report on restoring devolution in Northern Ireland within five days of4 September.

The Institute for Government think-tank warned in a report this week that there are limited opportunities for MPs to initiate the process – and said that cancelling the traditional break in sittings to allow for party conference season still may not give them enough time. Asthe reportexplains:
Before it all kicks off in Westminster again, the G7 meets in France on24-26 of August. Boris Johnson is set to have his first face-to-face meeting with US President Donald Trump at this meeting of world powers in the seaside town of Biarritz.
He’ll also have the opportunity to speak in person to the likes of Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel (but not Leo Varadkar – a date for the first one-on-one meeting between the Irish and UK leaders is still yet to be confirmed).

People will be interested to hear what US Vice President Mike Pence has to say about Brexit and the Good Friday Agreementwhen he visits Irelandon6 September. The visit comes in the wake of Democrat Nancy Pelosi’swarningthat a US-UK trade deal will not pass through Congress if it undermines the peace agreement.
In the UK again, the traditional three-week break for party conferences, mentioned above, takes place frommid-September to mid-October– but, again as stated above, there’s a chance that won’t happen at all this year if MPs manage to take control of Commons business.
On the parliamentary front here, the Dáil won’t be returning until17 September– but we can expect Brexit to dominate the agenda at the various party think-ins taking place in the preceding weeks.
Looking slightly further ahead, Budget Day here will be on8 Octoberand the next EU summit won’t take place until October17-18.
Amidst all that – here’s one last date for your calendar: some pundits in the UKreckon10 Octoberis Boris Johnson’s best bet for a snap general election.
Safe to say, after a prolonged break Brexit-watchers will be hearing a lot more chuntering of “order” from this man from the start of next month…

https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-lou-mcdoanld-brexit-4804524-Sep2019/,"SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has said Boris Johnson is following a Brexit “fantasy” and his plan is “profoundly stupid and immeasurably dangerous”.
Speaking at her party’s away day in Louth, she said Ireland faces its greatest threat and challenge in a generation.
McDonald said the British Prime Minister is following a fantasy “in which the rights and interests of the Irish people can be readily cast aside”.
“So it’s time to call Mr Johnson’s fantasy for what it is  – profoundly stupid and immeasurably dangerous. Mr Johnson’s stupid dangerous fantasy cannot become Arlene’s nightmare. Because Brexit is a very English problem. And the consequences of it cannot be shifted on to Ireland.
No blinking
“As the 31st of October approaches and pressure mounts, neither the Taoiseach or Michel Barnier can blink in the face of Tory intransigence – too much is at stake,” she said.
Her comments come after the UK parliament was officially suspended in the early hours of Tuesday morning after MPs rejected Boris Johnson’s second attempt to force a general election.
Calling the path the UK prime minister is taking with Brexit, in which he argues that the backstop has to be removed from the withdrawal agreement if a deal is to be done, in McDonald’s view is fantasy and would have profound impacts on the island of Ireland, including the re-establishment of the border.
Johnson’s plan will result in the re-imposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland, according to McDonald today.
“So the British Prime Minister needs to hear this, that the Irish people will not allow our country, our communities, our economy or our peace to be vandalised by him. There can be no return of a hard border, no customers checks, no more division on this island to suit the needs of a British government that has no interest in our future,” added McDonald.
Speaking about the backstop, she said it was a concept first tabled by Sinn Féin.
She said “no viable alternative exists to the backstop; it’s not perfect by any means but it’s the least worst option; broad Irish opinion supports that. This isn’t about us stamping our feet, this is a compromise solution, a minimum insurance policy”.

Earlier in the morning, she toldRTÉ’s Morning Ireland:

“We argued the solution for Ireland was we needed a bespoke arrangement. That’s something DUP pushed back on, and British government. This is the necessary solution for the whole island,” she said, adding:
“It’s a dangerous idea that a veto would be afforded – not to the unionist people – but to the DUP. The DUP doesn’t represent the views of business in the North or of broad society. The solution is the backstop. It was initially conceived as an Ireland-only measure.”
The Sinn Féin leader began her address to her party members on a conciliatory note, hinting to the party’s poor performance in May’s local elections.
“We have heard what you have said, and we are acting on it.”
Abstentionism
Predicting that the next UK general election will take place in the next six months, she said her party will run on an abstentionist ticket again.
“No true Irish republican would ever take a seat in the British Parliament, much less swear an oath to the British crown,” she said. Taking a pop at Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, she said that if Fianna Fáil think differently, let them contest the election on a “go-to-Westminster and see how they get on”.
She said Sinn Féin are abstentionists from Westminster, while Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are abstentionists from the north of Ireland.
She added that both parties have been abstentionists for half a century, a comment which drew a loud applause from the audience of Sinn Féin members this morning.
She said both parties “abandoned northern nationalists”.
“They will not lecture us and they will not lecture northern nationalism, no chance.”
On the issue of the next Budget, she said there is no room for “tokenistic” tax cuts that benefit the well off.
She said that a more rounded budget that will protect everyone with Brexit on the horizon is needed, adding that her party was calling for a €2 billion Brexit stability fund.
“We have to prepare for the economic shock of Brexit,” she said, adding that now is the time that the Irish government should be planning for a united Ireland.
A new pollhas shown just over half of people in Northern Ireland would vote for Irish unification if there were a border poll tomorrow.
“Unity simply makes sense,” she said, stating that making preparations now for a united Ireland “is the responsible thing to do”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-border-brexit-ready-4749430-Aug2019/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has allocated additional funding to no-deal Brexit preparations to speed up recruitment of extra border control officials ahead of the 31 October deadline.
Boris Johnson has approved an additional £2.1 billion in funding to be spent on recruiting 500 new officers, an advertising campaign, and providing assistance to traders in the UK ahead of what looks likely to be the UK crashing out of the EU in 90 days time.
Speaking on BBC radio 4′sTodayprogramme, secretary to the treasury, Rishi Sunak said 250 of those officials will be on the front line for the 1 November, with the rest coming on stream in the months following.
“The good news is we have already been preparing and investing in our borders, at £2.1 billion for Brexit preparedness in the last financial year, and an additional £2.1 billion this year, ” he said.
“The procedures have been centralised and have sped it up and 250 of those will be on the front line at the end of October, with a further 250 to come over the coming months.”
The announcement was heavily criticised by opposition politicians in the UK, who said the £2.1 billion would be better spent on other areas while a no-deal Brexit was “avoidable”.
“This is an appalling waste of taxpayers’ cash, all for the sake of Boris Johnson’s drive towards a totally avoidable no-deal,” shadow chancellor John McDonnell said.

Sunak denied the government was wasting taxpayers money, insisting the money would have been spent on Brexit anyway, whether there was a deal with Europe or not.
“A lot of the money we are spending is going to go on things that we would need to spend anyway because we are leaving the EU.
“That means we are going to be leaving the single market and the customs union, so of course that does mean changes to how we trade with Europe… that is money that we should be spending anyway for those new arrangements.”
Fear
Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar warned “we should be afraid of a no-deal Brexit” while speaking to reporters at an event in Kilkenny today.
Varadkar said that Britain leaving the EU without a deal “would have very serious impacts on the economy, north and south, and on Britain.”
“It could have security implications as well and it could have constitutional implications. In terms of fear, I think we should be afraid of a no-deal Brexit.”
Tensions have heightened recently after Britain’s new prime minister Boris Johnson waited almost a week before contacting the Irish premier, after he took office, despite speaking to other world leaders.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson will attempt to save his Brexit plan this week after his French counterpart warned that the EU would decide within days whether an agreement would be possible.
Johnson told Emmanuel Macron that Brussels should not be lured into the “mistaken belief” that Britain could extend its membership of the bloc beyond 31 October.
But in a telephone call yesterday, the French president reportedly informed Johnson that the EU will decide at the end of the week whether a deal is possible.
An Elysee official told the BBC: “The President told [Johnson] that the negotiations should continue swiftly with Michel Barnier’s team in coming days, in order to evaluate at the end of the week whether a deal is possible that respects European Union principles.”
Downing Street said Johnson made clear in calls to European leaders over the weekend that it was the final chance to strike a deal, but said the EU must match the compromises the UK has made.
The PM said he wanted to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both sides – and claimed that his new proposals commanded the support of MPs.
Number 10 warned Brussels that it would be an “historic misunderstanding” to believe the so-called Benn Act could prevent a no-deal Brexit – despite being designed to do so.
A senior Downing Street source said: “This is the chance to get a deal done: a deal that is backed by parliamentarians and a deal which involves compromise on all sides.
“The UK has made a big, important offer but it’s time for the Commission to show a willingness to compromise too. If not the UK will leave with no deal.

“The surrender act and its authors are undermining negotiations, but if EU leaders are betting that it will prevent no-deal, that would be a historic misunderstanding.”
Johnson is expected to speak with other European leaders today, and could travel to the continent later in the week in a bid to secure an agreement.
It is understood that the Government will consider publishing the full legal text, which has so far only been shared confidentially with Brussels, if it is deemed helpful to progress the negotiations.

Finnish prime minister Antti Rinne told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper in Germany after speaking to the PM that Johnson now understood “what a big mess this is”.
“That’s why I fear that the October summit would be more about extension than concrete solutions,” he said.
A decision is expected to be made today on whether Johnson can be forced by the courts to send a letter requesting an Article 50 extension.
Documents submitted to the Court of Session on behalf of Johnson were read out on Friday, in which he made it clear he will not attempt to frustrate the Benn Act.
But The Telegraph reported that the PM is willing to go to the Supreme Court in an effort to avoid having to write a letter asking for a delay to Brexit.
In Westminster, Jeremy Corbyn will meet the leaders of other opposition parties to scrutinise the Government’s new Brexit proposals and decide the next steps to “hold the Government to account”.
The Labour leader will meet the SNP’s Ian Blackford, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson and the Greens’ Caroline Lucas – as well as Anna Soubry of the Independent Group for Change and Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts – this afternoon.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-proposal-problems-4834066-Oct2019/,"WHAT DO BORIS Johnson’sself-proclaimed “fair and reasonable” backstop alternativesmean for the island of Ireland, and will they be something the EU will consider?
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke to the British Prime Minister by phone shortly before 6pm about his proposals, and said they do not fully meet “the agreed objectives of the backstop”.
But he also indicated that he would study them in further detail, and would consult with his EU colleagues, adding that he wants to see a deal agreed and ratified.
Meanwhile, the proposals are being softly dismissed by most commentators: former No 10 advisor and EU expert, Raoul Ruparel has alreadysaidthat the plan has “little to no chance of success”.
Although the Prime Minister has said in his Tory Party conference speech that “this is a compromise by the UK”, and asked the EU to “compromise in their turn”, otherwise “the alternative is no-deal” – it’s possible that these proposals are the basis for further negotiation that could lead to a deal.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has already welcomed the “positive advances” in the proposals, but added that there are “still some problematic points that will need further work”.
The EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said that”progress” has been made, but admits that “a lot of work still needs to be done”.
Juncker also said he would speak to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and “will listen carefully to his views”; Varadkar and Johnson also agreed that they would speak again next week.
There will be checks
A quick reminder:the backstopis meant to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland by removing the need for checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland if a future trade deal would mean rules and standards between the EU and the UK diverge.
The UK government has said repeatedly that it wants to “take back control” of the UK’s laws, rules and regulations, which suggests divergence from EU standards.
Originally, the backstop included aligning Northern Ireland only to the EU’s custom rules, but this changed to a UK-wide backstop after the DUP raised concerns about the integrity of the United Kingdom.
In Boris Johnson’s plans to replace the backstop, which is meant to avoid border checks, he suggests that there will have to be NI-ROI custom checks:
In practice, this will mean that all customs processes required by the UK and EU customs regimes will “take place electronically”, and with a “small number of physical checks needed conducted at traders’ premises or other points on the supply chain”.
The plans say that the system would operate based on “close cooperation” between the UK and Ireland, and that “a series of simplifications and improvements” will need to be made to legislation to ensure no checks or infrastructure at the border will be needed.
Northern Ireland will remain aligned with the EU’s rules on agrifood and industrial goods, which means regulatory checks with the rest of the UK.

The time limit is back
The Irish government in particular has been very vocal on a time-limited backstop not being a backstop – but that government line was based on a time limit that would be approved by the UK government and the EU together, and not by the Northern Ireland Executive.
The aims and objectives of the backstop is to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, facilitate North-South cooperation, and protect the integrity of the Single Market.
But if Stormont votes in favour of applying laws on agri-food and manufactured goods, and every four years after that, those aims may be covered through giving Northern Ireland political representatives a vote. It’s also worth noting that this vote also solves the “anti-democratic” moniker given by Johnson to the backstop.
If this type of time limit is accepted, it will be a climb-down of sorts for the Irish government, who has said “a time-limited backstop is not a backstop” an unlimited amount of times.
This proposal, as explained above, leads to a imposition/change in Northern Ireland that - it seems very clear to me -@LeoVaradkarwill not, cannot accept.It's not just about abstruse ""technology""...it's about cars and cows and livelihoods. /12— Peter Foster (@pmdfoster)October 2, 2019Peter Foster/ Twitter

The UK is asking the EU to trust them
This paragraph of Johnson’s proposals is essentially asking that the EU trust the UK, and not carry out any checks on whether Vat has been paid on goods crossing the border.
“The UK and the EU should cooperate to minimise evasion and ensure payment of the tax in the country where it is due,” the proposals state.
Since the beginning of this row over the backstop, the EU has said that it wants “legally operable solutions” to the stalemate over the border. This request on VAT and excise is essentially a legal loophole in the tax part of the Single Market – something that won’t sit well with EU leaders.
The technology thing
Although the words “technology” or “tracking” aren’t in the explanatory note, the proposals state the following in relation to customs:
Ashas been pointed out, “transit mechanism could mean that goods crossing the border will need to be tracked to ensure that they are adhering to customs rules, and tracking mechanism could either be costly, in terms of the sheer volume of data that’s needed, or else require physical infrastructure somewhere, which is exactly what the EU and Irish government is trying to avoid.

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said repeatedly that the backstop reform wouldn’t be enough to make the Withdrawal Agreement palatable for Brexiteers.
If the EU does as Johnson asks, and makes compromises on the backstop in order to secure another Withdrawal Agreement – how strong a guarantee can Boris Johnson give that it will pass through the House of Commons?
If it was rejected, that would leave the EU in a worse political bind than if it rejected these latest suggestions, and granted an extension or faced into a no-deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/central-bank-letter-budget-2020-4786011-Aug2019/,"THE GOVERNMENT HAS been urged to be “prudent” in October’s Budget by Acting Governor of the Central Bank, Sharon Donnery.
In her annual pre-Budget submission letter to the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe she said such an approach will be “critical” to ensure Ireland has “room to manoeuvre” and is buffered against any future downturns in the economy.
However, if windfalls are going to be to be used, they should be used to reduce Ireland’s debt, which stands at just over €200 billion.
The national debt rose to €206 billion last year, an increase of €5 billion, according to a government reportpublished this month.
The annual report on Public Debt states this is the equivalent of €42,500 for every person living in the State, one of the highest in the OECD.
The national debt is about four times what it was before the recession.

The Central Bank advice follows on from the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) stating that the chances of arecession in Ireland are 100%.
National debt
The acting governor noted the importance of reducing public debt in the current favourable financial market conditions, stating that fiscal windfalls, including those from corporation tax, could be ring-fenced to play a part in reducing the public debt burden.
She urged that earlier proposals made in Budget 2017 to introduce an Irish specific debt target of 45% of GDP “should be formalised by the government as soon as possible”.
Addressing the “specific substantial challenges” facing the country, she said the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit would have an immediate and severe impact on almost all areas of economic activity.
She said certain sectors such as agriculture, food production and manufacturing which  have particularly strong links to the UK will be “disproportionately affected by the imposition of tariffs and non-tariff barriers such as increased border delays and significantly increased administrative requirements for firms exporting goods both to the UK as a final destination and through the UK to continental Europe”.
If a disorderly Brexit can be avoided, the economy is expected to perform strongly in 2019 and 2020. However, she warned the government that there is a “material risk that continued expansion would give rise to overheating pressures”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michel-barnier-no-deal-brexit-4791190-Sep2019/,"EU CHIEF BREXIT negotiator Michel Barnier has said the bloc will not change the divorce deal agreed with Britain and that he is “not optimistic” of avoiding a no-deal outcome.
Barnier said the most contentious element of the agreement, the so-called backstop mechanism aimed at keeping the Northern Irish border open in all circumstances, must remain.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who took power last month, has called for the provision to be scrapped in order to reach a new deal ahead of the country’s latest 31 October departure date.
Johnson has said he was encouraged in his bid to axe the backstop by recent meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who appeared to suggest an openness to alternatives.
But writing in Britain’sSunday Telegraph, Barnier said Brussels remained unconvinced after “intense discussions with EU member states on the need to guarantee the integrity of the EU’s Single Market, while keeping that border fully open”.
“The backstop is the maximum amount of flexibility that the EU can offer to a non-member state,” he stated.
The EU negotiator also said discussions about alternatives to the backstop could not begin until Britain had approved the divorce deal struck with Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May late last year.
It was subsequently rejected three times by British MPs, leading Brexit to be delayed to 31 October.
“We are ready to start this work immediately upon ratification of the withdrawal agreement, in parallel to finally creating clarity on our future relationship,” Barnierstated.
He added that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would be London’s decision.

“Many people in the UK understand that and I would be surprised if they succumb to the idea that the EU is to blame for a difficult political situation in the UK.”
Alternatives
On Friday, Tánaiste Simon Coveney called on the British government to recommendviable alternatives to the backstopto the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator as quickly as possible.
Coveney met with British foreign secretary Dominic Raab on Friday.
A spokesman for the Tánaiste said that he reiterated Ireland’s position on the withdrawal agreement and said the red lines agreed between the EU and UK were not negotiable.
He also urged the British government to bring forward any viable alternatives to the backstop, which achieve the same goal of no hard border or related infrastructure on the island of Ireland, to EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier as quickly as possible.
Yesterday, thousands of protestersrallied in dozens of British citiesagainst Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament weeks before Brexit.
Queen Elizabeth II gave her approval to Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament for several weeks on Wednesday. This instantly sparked widespread outrage, legal challenges and promises of resistance from parliamentarians.
The move was widely seen as a way of limiting the time Johnson’s opponents have to organise against him.
The main opposition Labour Party has said it is also considering a no-confidence vote in Johnson’s Conservative government, which commands a fragile 320 to 319 majority.

No more than Brexit itself, the process has been quite drawn out. So, what exactly is the timeline at this stage?
The plan is for Theresa May’s successor to be announced on 23 July. May is expected to officially hand in her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II the following day.
Her replacement will either be Boris Johnson (the clear frontrunner, according to polls) or Jeremy Hunt, who succeeded Johnson as Foreign Secretary.
The men were chosen from a field of 10 after a series of votes by the Conservative Party’s 313 MPs.
Hustings have been held across the UK in recent weeks, with a final one due to take place in London on 17 July.
Ultimately, thenew leaderwill be chosen by the Tory party’s some 160,000 members. Ballots were sent to members earlier this month and the deadline for voting is 5pm on 22 July.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party could call an immediate vote of confidence in the new prime minister once they take up the role, to force them to prove they have the support to govern.

This would have to happen by 25 July when parliament is due to begin its summer break, or wait until MPs return on 3 September.
Brexit deadline
The Conservatives do not have a majority in the House of Commons, but govern through an alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party.
May announced her resignation last month after failing to get her Brexit deal through parliament, faced with opposition from both Conservative MPs and the DUP.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the Withdrawal Agreement, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The DUP, which campaigned in favour of Brexit, believes the backstop threatens the UK and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
The new Prime Minister is expected to attend the G7 summit in Biarritz in France from 25-27 August. They are also due to attend a European Union summit on 17 and 18 October if Britain is still in the bloc at that stage.
Barring a third postponement or an earlier departure, Britain is due to leave the EU on 31 October. Plans are being made at British, Irish and European levels in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnsons-first-pmqs-4795437-Sep2019/,"HALFWAY THROUGH BORIS Johnson’s first bout of Prime Minister’s Questions (and possibly his last), House Speaker John Bercow reminded MPs that there was a delegation of Lebanese parliamentarians watching proceedings today, adding that he wasn’t sure what impression they were getting of UK parliamentary procedure.
You’d imagine that they got exactly what they had hoped for.
In a jaw-dropping bout of verbal jabs, political posturing and repeated slips from House of Commons’ etiquette, Johnson’s usual eloquent zingers were scant.
With each question posed by a Labour MP, the Prime Minister would end his reply with a request that the MP in question would ask Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to hold a general election:
In a number of eccentric insults thrown at Corbyn – who had an unusually good outing in the House of Commons – Johnson called the Labour leader a “chlorinated chicken”, and a “great big girl’s blouse” for not backing his wish for a general election on 15 October.
He also took aim at London Mayor Sadiq Khan, saying that the sooner he is out of the role “the better”;Khan respondedby saying that this was done to avoid a question about whether the 20,000 promised police officers would go to the front line.
Corbyn, meanwhile, said he hoped no more female aides would be “frogmarched” out of No 10 (“and at gunpoint!” another MP added), in reference toDominic Cummingsfiring an aide of Sajid Javid without his knowledge.
One of the most silent moments of the entire bout of this roaring edition of Prime Minister’s Questions was when David Gauke, who lost the Tory whip after voting against the government last night, calmly asked: “The Prime Minister has said that the prorogation of parliament has nothing to do with Brexit. Is that still his position?”
Johnson rattled off a condensed version of answers he has given before, saying “this parliament has lasted longer than any in almost 400 years”, and said there would be “ample time” to debate Brexit.

It resulted in two powerful rounds of applause from opposition MPs, which was allowed by John Bercow despite clapping in the House of Commons being banned.
Johnson’s response was to say that in his column, he argued against banning burqas. He continued that he has Muslim ancestors and is related to a Sikh “like himself”.
Johnson wasasked beforeto apologise for those remarks he made, to which he replied that he would continue to speak as he always has: “If I use phrases and language that cause offence, I’m sorry for causing offence but I will continue to speak as directly I can.”
And he was true to his word, in this instance at least. In another example of a slip from the UK parliament’s strict decorum, Johnson uttered the phrase “shit or bust”, while apparently quoting the opposition.
“The Shadow Education Secretary says that their economic policy is, and I quote Mr Speaker, by your leave, shit or bust. I say, I say it’s both.”
The quips and insults weren’t confined to Prime Minister’s Questions either: in response to Sadiq Khan’s statement, John McDonnell was interrupted by Johnson. So he responded:
That is, of course, a reference to thealleged domestic incidentat the apartment of Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds where the police were called by neighbours who said they heard a heated argument.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson “have been in contact” and hope to meet each other in New York next week, it has been confirmed.
Varadkar is due to travel to the US next week where he will give a speech at the special UN Summit on Climate Action in New York.
He will then travel onwards to Los Angeles on a trade mission and will also inaugurate the new Irish consulate in LA.
The spotlight is back on Johnson today, after he was given a 12-day timeline to set out his Brexit plan by the Finland’s prime minister.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the deadline given to Johnson “shows the level of frustration” in the EU.
Finland’s prime minister Antti Rinne said he and French President Emmanuel Macron yesterday agreed the UK should give Europe a written copy of the proposals by the end of September.
“We both agreed that it is now time for Boris Johnson to produce his own proposals in writing – if they exist.
“If no proposals are received by the end of September, then it’s over,” Rinne told reporters after his meeting with Macron.
In response, a Downing Street source toldBBC Newsthat confidential documents that “reflect the ideas the UK has put forward” on Brexit have been shared with the EU.
It is reported that UK ministers will table “formal written solutions when we are ready” and not to an “artificial deadline”, said the UK government.
No credible alternatives
The lack of written legal documents from the UK is cause for concern to the Tanaiste.
With only a few weeks out from the Brexit deadline of 31 October, “we haven’t seen any credible alternatives” to the withdrawal agreement, said Coveney.
“There is still a big gap from what the British government has been suggesting that they are looking for and what the EU and Ireland need in terms of getting a deal, and in order to close that gap we need to get credible proposals from the British government which we simply haven’t seen yet,” he added.
Stating that he wanted to give a “straight answer” to reporters this morning, he said “until we get a proposal in writing then there isn’t a lot of credibility to what is being said” by the British side in terms of alternatives.
He said legal text is required to solve the complex problems like the backstop, which Johnson wants removed from the withdrawal agreement.
Coveney said he has asked his British counterparts why written text has not been provided yet, stating:
He said he can only assume that the British government is working on written alternatives, stating:
The Tánaiste encouraged the UK to submit the documents as soon as possible.
While Coveney spoke to the media today, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid MP is meeting with Finance and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe in Dublin.

This is the third time the ministers have met in the eight weeks since the Chancellor took up his position, which the Department of Finance said in a statement this afternoon, reflects the importance of economic relations between Ireland and the United Kingdom.
“The ministers will discuss Brexit and the importance of maintaining a strong economic relationship as the UK leaves the EU. They will also exchange perspectives on the latest international economic developments,” it said.
Speaking in advance of the engagement, Donohoe said:
Commenting ahead of the visit Chancellor Javid said:
“Ireland is an essential partner for the United Kingdom, and I am determined that we maintain and enhance this relationship as we leave the EU.
“Our discussions today will also help improve our mutual understanding of the issues facing the UK and Ireland – and better understanding leads to better outcomes.
“Both countries remain steadfast in our commitment to upholding the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement as the UK leaves the EU on 31 October.”
The meeting of ministers comes follows on from a meeting held between DUP leader Arlene Foster and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Government Buildings last night.
The meeting lasted for 45 minutes where they discussed Brexit and ongoing efforts to restore the Northern Ireland Assembly. A statement released after the meeting said they “agreed to stay in touch”.
Foster yesterday indicated for the first time that she may be open to a Brexit solution that would involvespecial arrangementsfor the North.
Speaking about the meeting today, Coveney said it was “positive” and “friendly”.
“We need to be careful that this doesn’t get interpreted as some sort of break through because I don’t think it is,” he said, stating that the meeting “didn’t solve all problems”.

At the press conference today Transport Minister Shane Ross was also asked about whether he felt vindicated for stating some months ago that there would be customs checks, a statement that did not go down well with his Fine Gael colleagues at the time.
In January, there was widespread surprise after the Independent Alliance TD suggested that Border checks would be inevitable in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
At the time that Tánaiste Simon Coveney had to warn Ross not to discuss the possibility of Border checks in public for fear “that all of a sudden we’ll be the Government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland”.
Speaking in an interview withTheJournal.iethis month, Ross said: “I put my foot in it already by saying that checks were going to happen. Everyone took my head off and I was right.”
“I said it that day, and I was asked the question, I thought it was the honest reply, which it was. It was obvious.”
The TD admits that he “wasn’t very popular with my Fine Gael colleagues for saying it” but that “they were very good about it. They’d rather it was something I hadn’t said.
Standing next to the Tánaiste this morning, Ross said he was “premature” his statement in January adding that there “were a lot of things going on at the time”.
“I don’t feel any sense of vindication, I feel what I said turned out to be true and lets leave it at that,” he said.

TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said, regardless of who is the British prime minister, a no-deal Brexit “will be a disaster for us all”.
A new prime minister is set to be announced this week, with pro-Brexit Boris Johnson the favourite to succeed Theresa May.
Writing in theSunday Times, Coveney said Ireland “will work closely with the new prime minister to advance our shared interests, notably safeguarding peace on our island — the single biggest achievement we share with successive British governments”.
Following a deadline extension, Britain is due to leave the European Union on 31 October. Plans are being made at British, Irish and European level in the event of a no-deal scenario, which seems increasingly likely.
The Tánaiste and Foreign Affairs Minister said the decisions made by the new prime minister, be it Johnson or current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, in the coming months will impact both people living in the UK and people living in Ireland.
‘One red line’
In the column, Coveney stated that Ireland has “one red line” in relation to Brexit, namely that “nothing should be done to put at risk peace on the island of Ireland”.
Coveney said if Britain decides to leave the EU without a deal, “it would cause huge damage to us all”, adding that such a scenario would “devastate the Northern Irish economy”.
He said the Withdrawal Agreement, which has been rejected by the House of Commons three times, is “a balanced document that deals with the interests of all parties and is not something that is up for renegotiation”.

‘A British choice’
Coveney echoed these sentiments in an interview on theBBC’s Andrew Marr Show, saying: “This is a British choice. We all want to avoid a no-deal Brexit and we have worked for three years to try to do that.
“I have done very little else in politics apart from focus on the choice of the British people to leave the European Union, and its impact on Ireland and the EU.”

On Thursday, MPs in Westminster backed a bid to stop the new prime minister from suspending parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit – 315 MPs voted in favour of the amendment, while 274 voted against it.
Hunt has ruled out suspending parliament if he is voted in as leader, butJohnson has not.
Backstop
The Conservatives do not have a majority in the House of Commons, but govern through an alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party.
May announced her resignation after failing to get her Brexit deal through parliament, faced with opposition from both Conservative MPs and the DUP.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The DUP, which campaigned in favour of Brexit, believes the backstop threatens the UK and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.

AFTER THE EUROPEAN Council agreed to grant the UK’s request to push back the Brexit date to 31 October, its President Donald Tusk said, “Please don’t waste this time.”
With just nine weeks left out of that29-week extension, the Withdrawal Agreement is no more likely to be passed in the House of Commons, and the EU and UK are no closer to reaching a different compromise.
Now, the prorogation of parliament means that there is even less time for the House of Commons to settle on what they want: the parliament will be suspended from somewhere between the 9 and 12 September until 14 October. Although three weeks of this had included the annual recess to allow for party conferences, it had been suggested that MPs would propose a vote to forgo that tradition to grapple with the Brexit crisis its country is in.
It takes aroundfour weeksfor legislation to pass through the House of Commons, after which it goes to the House of Lords for a similar time period (bills can also begin in the House of Lords, too).
Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested holding meetings twice a week with EU officials for the whole ofSeptemberto try to glean a solution to the current deadlock.
Xinhua News Agency / PA ImagesXinhua News Agency / PA Images / PA Images
On Tuesday, MPs will return from their six-week summer recess – which beganone dayafter Boris Johnson became Prime Minister – to battle once again over Brexit.
Johnson has vowed to leave with or without a deal on 31 October, but MPs aren’t happy with either of those options – having rejected the Withdrawal Agreement three times by large majorities, and also rejecting a no deal under any circumstances.
In March, during a series of votes on how to take Brexit forward, a majority of 321 MPs voted against a no-deal Brexit at any time, with 278 voting in favour.
We’re expecting an effort from parliamentarians soon after they return to propose legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit, but as mentioned above, they don’t have much time to do that.
Despite an agreement by all opposition parties in the House of Commons to prioritise this legislation, the proroguing of parliament puts a motion of no confidence back on the table.

If Johnson loses this, he has14 daysto win another no-confidence vote, which isn’t likely to happen. If he doesn’t win a second one, parliament will dissolve and a general election will be called within25 days.

Three legal challengeshave sprouted from Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament – in London, Belfast and Edinburgh.
On Friday last week, Lord Raymond Doherty told the Court of Session in Edinburgh that he wouldn’t place an interim injunction on the parliament suspension, but said that the full hearing would be heard on Tuesday 3 September.
The legal action taken in London by campaigner Gina Miller and former Prime Minister John Major will be heard by the courts on Thursday 5 September.
Johnson is also to visit Dublin inearly September(we have no more specific information than that) so keep an eye out for when he may be landing.

As we all well know,this WednesdayQueen Elizabeth II agreed to suspend parliament – a procedure known as “proroguing” – in the second week of September on Johnson’s request.
This erases the legislative agenda and starts it anew: Johnson claimed it was being done to roll out a “bold and ambitious domestic legislative agenda”, while others including House Speaker John Bercow said it was “blindingly obvious” that it was being done to close any gaps left to thwart a no-deal Brexit.
The precise date of suspension is up to the government and a debate is currently scheduled on legislation relating to Northern Ireland on9 September, so it seems likely that the suspension will occur after that. That same day, EU negotiator Michel Barnier is due to give a speech in Queen’s University Belfast on “Brexit and the Future of Europe”.

The House of Commons takes a recess every year at this time so that Britain’s main political parties can hold their annual conferences, to be dominated this year by discussions over Brexit, proroguing parliament, and Boris.
Johnson will make his first appearance as party head at the Tories’ gathering in Manchester from29 September to 2 October.
Meanwhile, the Brexit Party will have been holding clusters of events around the UK, with a dozen separate dates marked inSeptemberalone. Off the back of their surprising surge in the European elections, they’re looking to gather support for any upcoming general elections (currently rumoured for10 October). As it stands, it already has635 candidateson its approved list.

MPs will reconvene for a new parliamentary session with a speech by Queen Elizabeth II setting out the government’s legislative plans, which Johnson has said will focus on health and crime.
It will most likely be consumed by Britain’s impending departure from the EU just over two weeks later, with a crunch vote possible on any Brexit deal newly-agreed with the EU.
Leader of the House Jacob Rees Moggsaidthat although there arefour to five daysset aside to specifically debate the government’s new legislative agenda, MPs will be able to table motions on the UK’s looming departure from the EU.

The final European Council summit before the Brexit deadline will see leaders from across the 28-member bloc meet in Brussels, in what is expected to be the most illuminating of all the dates mentioned thus far.
There hasn’t been much budging from the original Brexit positions we’ve had before: the EU says the Withdrawal Agreement is not up for renegotiation and the backstop stays, while the UK says the parliament has rejected this deal three times, and they want a new deal (probably without the backstop).
As Johnson admitted himself this week and numerous times before, he’s hoping that the threat of a no-deal Brexittwo weeks laterwill be enough to secure concessions to the deal that he can take back to London for parliamentary approval.
The House of Commons will vote on21 and 22 Octoberon the government’s legislative agenda, 10 Downing Street said in a statement on the prorogation, which are expected to be a de-facto vote on a no-deal Brexit.
The deadline for Britain’s departure from the EU after more than four decades of membership.
Originally scheduled to leave on 29 March, then pushed back to 12 April, the appetite for a third extension within the European Council will be waning fast, particularly as the political and constitutional crisis in the UK deepens.

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-poll-united-ireland-london-brexit-no-deal-sinn-fein-4805119-Sep2019/,"PLANS ARE BEING drawn up in London for a united Ireland. A team of academics, based in University College London, are starting a new project that hopes to investigate how a border poll could be designed, held and implemented.
With Brexit and fears over a hard border raising the prospect of a united Ireland, Irish, British and Northern Ireland academics are working together to consider how a border poll could be conducted.
A report, expected in 12 months, will draw on a range of experts from the fields of constitutional law, conflict resolution and political science.
The project is being led from University College London’s Constitution Unit, which specialises on research into constitutional reform.
It will look beyond simply how a border poll would be conducted in Northern Ireland, but also at what kind of constitutional change might be necessary in Ireland too.
While the project is still in its early stages, it will examine whether Ireland might need to hold more than one referendum – such as one before negotiations on a united Ireland and one following such negotiations.
In 1998, both Ireland and Northern Ireland approved the Good Friday Agreement in simultaneous votes.
‘Timely’
“We have seen an extraordinarily badly designed referendum process in relation to Brexit,” Dr Alan Renwick, the leader of the project and an expert on referendums and elections at University College London, toldTheJournal.ie.
“This makes getting the process right in Northern Ireland particularly important.”
Renwick said that there was something of a reluctance to start thinking about the issue of a unity referendum. “Both UK and Irish politicians are reluctant to encourage this process in the short term and to talk about it,” he said.
Renwick does hope, however, that politicians will decide to give their views as part of the process.
In Ireland, academics from both Trinity College Dublin and University College are involved. From the North, staff from Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University will also contribute to the project, which has received funding from the British Academy.
David Kenny, an expert on constitutional law in Trinity, said that the project was “timely”.

Ireland’s experience of citizens’ assemblies is expected to feed into the project, which will consider everything from how a border poll would be triggered to how ballot papers will be designed in the event of a referendum.
Both Kenny and his colleague Dr Oran Doyle, who is also involved in the project, worked on citizens’ assemblies in Ireland ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum.
“We have that experience and both of us are interested in the role of citizen assemblies in framing constitutional questions,” Kenny said.
However, he warned that such bodies should not be seen as “quick fixes” for addressing complex policy questions.
While acknowledging that the project might face some opposition, especially from unionist communities, Kenny said that the questions couldn’t be ignored.

“You’re going to have to consider it at some point anyway,” he said.
Withsome polling indicatingthat support for a united Ireland is rising in Northern Ireland, significant questions remain about how the process could be carried out amid fears that a border poll could add further tension to a region experts think could be hardest hit by Brexit.
A Constitution Unit report,published in March, found that:
The project plans to engage with the public and civil society organisations over the next 12 months before making any recommendations on how a unity referendum could be facilitated and organised.
Renwick said that while a public event would be held in London, the main focus of the work will be in Ireland on both sides of the border.
The looming threat of a no-deal Brexit has prompted growing debate in Northern Ireland about a border poll.
Sinn Féin has repeatedly called on the Irish government toplan for a united Ireland, while in July 2018 former DUP leader Peter Robinsonsaid that the Northneeds to prepare for the possibility.
Meanwhile a new report, authored by academics from Trinity College Dublin and Dublin City University, has warned that unification would require a “major” cut in the standard of living in Ireland in order to allow Northern Ireland to maintain its own living standards.
The research, by John FitzGerald and Edgar LW Morgenroth, warns that “whatever form Irish unity took there would be a heavy economic cost for both Northern Ireland and Ireland”.

Johnson told the Mail on Sunday that despite parliament passing legislation to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, he would seek to leave anyway on that date even if no agreement had been reached with the EU.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson will ask for a Brexit extension if a withdrawal agreement has not been agreed by 19 October, court documents show.
According to documents submitted to the Court of Sessions in Scotland, the British government said that Johnson accepted that he was obliged to send a letter to the EU asking for a delay and that if an extension was granted, Britain would also agree to it.
The Conservative Party leader has continually said, should the EU reject his proposals, he is prepared to take the UK out of the bloc without a deal on 31 October – despite the Benn Act committing him to request an extension to Article 50 if a deal is not secured following the European Council meeting in less than two weeks’ time.
European leaders gave his fresh Brexit proposals short shrift yesterday, with senior figures dubbing his “two borders” customs suggestion for Northern Ireland “unconvincing”.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Ireland would likely agree to a request by the UK for an extension.
Speaking in Denmark, Varadkar said if Boris Johnson submits a request for an extension, he would agree.
“I’ve always said that Brexit doesn’t end with the UK leaving, it’s just the next phase of negotiations, but if the UK were to request and extension, we would consider it, most EU countries would only consider it for good reason, but an extension would be better than no deal,” he said.

Varadkar was speaking alongside the Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen, who also agreed to a Brexit extension, before he added that he still believes a deal is possible at the EU Council Summit in mid-October.
“Our focus is on securing an agreement and getting a deal at the EU Council Summit,” the Taoiseach added

The legal action – led by businessman Vince Dale, SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and Jolyon Maugham QC – is asking the court to require Mr Johnson to seek an extension to avoid leaving the EU without a deal.
Maughan told Sky News:
“What we learned today is that the prime minister has promised the court, in his own name, that he will ask for an extension under the Benn Act if the conditions are satisfied, in other words if parliament has not before 19 October agreed a withdrawal agreement.

But Maughan said Johnson’s public comments about committing to the October 31 date meant he was playing “a very odd game”.
“It’s a very difficult game to understand because I think he told the House of Commons yesterday that we would leave come what may on October 31, and I do not understand how that statement can be reconciled with the promises that he’s made to the court today.

Eurosceptic MP Steve Baker insisted that the Prime Minister would still meet the October 31 date.
Baker, leader of the European Research Group of Brexiteer Tories, told the PA news agency: “A source has confirmed that this just means the Government will obey the law but the source confirmed we will leave on 31 October.
“It’s not really a development in the position.”
Asked whether that means leaving without a new Withdrawal Agreement in place, he said: “We’re going to leave with or without a deal come what may.”
But Baker said he did not know what the Government’s plan was to get around the Benn Act if necessary.

https://www.thejournal.ie/theresa-mays-brexit-deal-and-boris-johnson-4856832-Oct2019/,"THE KEY DIFFERENCES between Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and Boris Johnson’s version of it are the alternative arrangement  to the Irish backstop, a consent mechanism for the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the level-playing field provision.
The vast majority of the Withdrawal Agreement is untouched from its original format – with the changes focused on the two elements that pro-Brexit MPs took issue with the last three times a vote was taken on it (although the financial settlement has been reduced from £39 billion to £33 billion because of the extension).
Today’s vote in the House of Commons will clarify whether there was a legitimate concern over these elements, which Brexiteers claimed would locked the UK in a customs union that restricted the it from future trade deals, and agreeing to rules that would make the UK less competitive post-Brexit.
Despite nothing much in the 585-pageWithdrawal Agreementhaving been changed, the things that have been changed are complicated to explain.
1. The backstop is gone
The backstop, was a plan B in the Withdrawal Agreement that would be implemented if an alternative agreement to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland couldn’t be found.
It would keep Northern Ireland aligned to the European Union’s Custom Union and Single Market, which Brexiteers argued would mean the UK couldn’t avail of future trade deals (Theresa May rejected a Northern Ireland-only backstop in favour of a UK-wide one in order to protect ‘the integrity of the union’).
The backstop’s replacement is similar to the original Northern Ireland-only backstop, with the additional issue of consent to make the mechanism less “antidemocratic”.
Advertisement
In short, it means that Northern Ireland will remain aligned to the EU’s Custom Union, but will be in the United Kingdom’s custom territory, meaning that if there are future trade deals struck, Northern Ireland would avail of them.
In practice, this would mean that if goods are sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, no tariffs apply. If goods are sent from Great Britain through Northern Ireland to Ireland, tariffs will apply, but they will be collected at ports and airports – effectively putting a customs border along the Irish Sea.
For goods sent from Ireland to Northern Ireland, there would be no tariffs, and for goods travelling from Ireland through Northern Ireland to Great Britain, there would be tariffs collected at the Irish Sea customs border.
2. Consent
This was an important part of the discussions, as it proved difficult to capture what true “consent” from Northern Ireland would be.
If the Withdrawal Agreement is passed by the House of Commons today, this arrangement will come into effect at the end of the transition period, which will end in December 2020 (or December 2022 if it’s extended).
Four years after that, (but two months before the deadline), the Northern Ireland Assembly will get a vote on whether to keep this customs arrangement, or default to “existing” WTO rules.
Speaking to reporters in Brussels yesterday, the Taoiseach said: “So there is of course an outside chance that at some point in the latter part of the next decade… [an] Assembly might decide to opt out of alignment, opt out of the Single Electricity Market, opt out of the new customs arrangement.
On the vote itself, if a simple majority is achieved (so half of the total of votes cast, plus one more vote at least), it would extend the arrangements for another four years.
If they receive a cross-party consensus, meaning a majority of 60%, and at least 40% support from unionists and nationalists, then the arrangements will be extended by eight years.

Although the DUP is opposing the deal over customs, consent and VAT reasons, and fears that it would severe the North’s link with the rest of the United Kingdom, the Taoiseach said that in his view, it did not change its “constitutional status”.
3. The Political Declaration
The “level-playing field” provision was another sticking point for UK-EU negotiators. It essentially aimed to create a base level of standards for labour rights, the environment, tax and state aid rules.
This is so as to ensure state aid rules aren’t used by either side to boost their own companies; labour rules aren’t lowered in order to increase company profits; or environmental standards aren’t renegned upon in order to become more competitive post-Brexit.
This had been a legally-binding agreement contained in the Withdrawal Agreement – it’s now stated in thePolitical Declaration:
“the Parties agree to develop an ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced economic partnership. This partnership will be comprehensive, encompassing a Free Trade Agreement, as well as wider sectoral cooperation where it is in the mutual interest of both Parties.
“It will be underpinned by provisions ensuringa level playing fieldfor open and fair competition, as set out in Section XIV of this Part. It should facilitate trade and investment between the Parties to the extent possible, while respecting the integrity of the Union’s Single Market and the Customs Union as well as the United Kingdom’s internal market, and recognising the development of an independent trade policy by the United Kingdom.”
Reference to a customs union as the baseline for a future trade deal, and UK alignment with EU regulations have also been removed.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-no-deal-businesses-ireland-4787099-Aug2019/,"BUSINESS MINISTER HEATHER Humphreys has said the government is telling businesses to “prepare for the worst possible outcome” in relation to Brexit.
Humphreys’ comments come after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday asked the Queen to suspend parliament from the second week in September until 14 October, less than two weeks before the UK is set to leave the European Union.
The Queen approved this request, and the move by Johnson has sparked outrage and condemnation from opposition MPs.
The move limits the time available to opposition MPs hoping to pass new laws that could prevent a no-deal Brexit before 31 October.
When asked by reporters today whether yesterday’s developments will make a hard border more likely, Minister for Communications Richard Bruton said: “I think it is very difficult to see the political hyping of the issues and the clock ticking away and a lot of political positioning rather than, you know, working the details of how resolutions can be found.
“I think it’s disheartening and it does make the risks greater.”
Speaking alongside Bruton, Humphreys said that the government has told businesses to “prepare for the worst possible outcome” while it continues to “find the best possible solution for Ireland”.
She continued:
“We do not want a hard border with Northern Ireland and I can assure you, I live on the border and nobody wants to see a border coming back between us and Northern Ireland, so we’re doing everything we can, talking to the [European] Commission, we’re working with them to find the solutions but it is not easy.”

The Irish SME Association yesterday said it is asking SMEs to “focus on taking simple steps towards business preparation for a hard Brexit”.
Backstop
Speaking onRTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said that in the past three years, what was happening was “unprecedented”.
“What’s clear for us is we need to remain calm,” she said. “We cannot allow the slate to be wiped clean when all this change continues to take place in the UK.”
When asked whether the UK government had put forward any credible, new alternatives to the backstop, McEntee said: “No.”
Echoing this sentiment, Humphreys said that “there will be no movement on the backstop”.
“The backstop is our insurance policy and it will remain,” she said.
Humphreys said that “there is nothing good in Brexit” for Ireland, but added that “the Withdrawal Agreement is the best possible outcome”.
Last night, protesters descended on the streets around Westminster to protest against Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament,chanting“If you shut down our parliament, we shut down the streets”.
A petitionagainst the proroguing of parliament unless there’s an extension to the Brexit deadline or Brexit is cancelled entirely, has reached over 1 million signatures in less than 24 hours.

TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has called on the British government to recommend viable alternatives to the backstop to the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator as quickly as possible.
It follows a vow by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to “step up the tempo” in talks with the European Union to strike a new Brexit deal before the 31 October deadline.
In comments last night, Johnson said he was ready to “get a deal done” that would allow Britain to leave the EU on 31 October, but would continue to seek an alternative to the imposition of a backstop, which would prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.
“While I have been encouraged with my discussions with EU leaders over recent weeks that there is a willingness to talk about alternatives to the anti-democratic backstop, it is now time for both sides to step up the tempo,” he said.
This morning, Coveney met with British foreign secretary Dominic Raab on the fringes of a meeting of all 28 EU foreign ministers.
A spokesman for the Tánaiste said that he reiterated Ireland’s position on the withdrawal agreement and said the red lines agreed between the EU and UK were not negotiable.
He also urged the British government to bring forward any viable alternatives to the backstop, which achieve the same goal of no hard border or related infrastructure on the island of Ireland, to EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier as quickly as possible.
Peace in Ireland
British negotiators are set to meet their EU counterparts twice a week throughout September in a bid to strike a new withdrawal agreement.
Lead Brexit negotiator David Frost will be joined in Brussels by different officials depending on the agenda for talks, including experts on customs, regulatory issues and trade policy, the government said.
“Discussions so far have shown that the two sides remain some distance apart on key issues but that both sides are willing to work hard to find a way through,” Downing Street said in a statement.
“The teams intend to run through a range of issues including the impasse around the backstop.

“The PM has been clear that there will be no new deal unless the withdrawal agreement is reopened and the backstop taken out,” it added.
However, the EU has warned that the bloc has a duty to protect peace in Ireland and will continue to do so, amid British plans to do away with the backstop.
Brussels insists that the backstop – which would keep the UK in EU customs arrangements – is essential to preserve the integrity of European trade and to avoid risking a return to sectarian violence.
“Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October. In all circumstances, the EU will continue to protect the interests of its citizens and companies, as well as the conditions for peace and stability on the island of Ireland,” Barnier tweeted yesterday.
“It is our duty and our responsibility.”

The backstop is included in a divorce deal the EU agreed with Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, which the House of Commons has rejected three times.
“The increase in meetings and discussions is necessary if we are to have a chance of agreeing a deal for when we leave on October 31; no ifs, no buts,” Johnson said.
The prime minister’s comments came amid legal challenges to his move to suspend parliament between mid-September and October 14.
However,a Scottish judge ruled against granting an interim order– the Scottish equivalent of an injunction – to stop the move this morning, pending a full court hearing.
Yesterday, Lord Raymond Doherty heard a bid for an interim interdict – the Scottish legal equivalent of an injunction – that would halt Johnson’s move to suspend parliament between mid-September and 14 October.
Legal bids to halt the move have also been launched in London and Belfast.

https://www.thejournal.ie/british-government-operating-on-assumption-of-no-deal-michael-gove-4743441-Jul2019/,"THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT is  “operating on the assumption” that Britain will leave the EU without a deal on 31 October, Michael Gove has said.
The newly-appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, writing in The Sunday Times, said there is a “very real prospect” that an agreement would not be struck with Brussels before the Halloween deadline.
“The EU’s leaders have, so far, said they will not change their approach — it’s the unreformed withdrawal agreement, take it or leave it,” Gove said.
Gove added that the government will do “everything in our power” to strike a “good agreement” with the EU but ruled out putting former Prime Minister Theresa May’s thrice-rejected deal before Parliament.
“You can’t just reheat the dish that’s been sent back and expect that will make it more palatable,” he wrote.
Planning for no deal Brexit was now a “number one priority”, Gove said.
“With a new prime minister, a new government, and a new clarity of mission, we will exit the EU on October 31. No ifs. No buts. No more delay. Brexit is happening,” Gove said.
Gove was appointed to his new role by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who took up office last week
‘Massive economic opportunity’
Speaking yesterday, Johnson said Brexit was a “massive economic opportunity” but had been treated under his predecessor Theresa May as “an impending adverse weather event”.
In a speech in Manchester where he pledged new investment in Leave-voting areas, Johnson promised to step up negotiations on post-Brexit trade deals and set up free ports to boost the economy.
“When people voted to leave the European Union, they were not just voting against Brussels, they were voting against London too,” he said.
Johnson promised to give more powers to local communities, as well as boost broadband and transport infrastructure in a speech focused on domestic issues.
“Taking back control doesn’t just apply to Westminster regaining sovereignty from the EU, it means our cities and counties and towns becoming more self governing,” he said.

When asked about the prospect of Brexit negotiations, Johnson said he was willing to engage with EU partners but only if the backstop clause was removed from the current divorce agreement struck by May.
The backstop seeks to ensure a free-flowing post-Brexit border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in all eventualities.
“The approach of the UK government is not going to be disengaged or aloof or waiting for them to come to us, we are going to try to solve this problem,” he said.
“We can’t do it as long as that anti-democratic backstop, that backstop that seeks to divide our country, divide the UK, remains in place. We need to get it out and then we can make progress.”
‘Unhelpful’
Over the past few days, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney have both given statements on the current Brexit state of play following the appointment of Johnson as the British Prime Minister.
Coveney said that Johnson’s comments on Brexit have been“unhelpful”.
“The statements of the British Prime Minister yesterday in the House of Commons were very unhelpful to this process,” Coveney told reporters on Friday.
“He seems to have made a deliberate decision to set Britain on a collision course with the European Union and with Ireland in relation to the Brexit negotiations, and I think only he can answer the question as to why he is doing that.”
Meanwhile, Johnson has also tried to dampen speculation he could call an early election.
Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the EU by the latest deadline of 31 October – deal or no deal.
But he has focused on domestic priorities in his first few days in office, including a pledge yesterday to reverse drastic cuts to the police force made under May.
Commentators have speculated that he could be preparing to call a general election, hoping to regain the Conservative majority that May lost at the polls in 2017.
Johnson yesterday “absolutely” ruled out initiating such a poll before Britain leaves the bloc.
“The British people voted in 2015, in 2016, in 2017,” he said during a visit to the central English city of Birmingham.
“What they want us to do is deliver on their mandate, come out of the EU on October 31.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-death-threats-no-deal-uk-4751821-Aug2019/,"A BREXIT-SUPPORTING BRITISH man has been jailed after sending abusive and threatening voice messages.
Sixty-four-year old Robert Vidler, who supports Brexit, was found guilty of harassing the staff of a range of UK politicians, including the Conservative Party’s Dominic Grieve and Nicky Morgan, as well as Labour’s Barry Gardiner and Sir Keir Starmer.
In total, six MPs were targeted with calls or voicemail messages that threatened to harm or kill them.
The messages and calls were taken by staff working for the MPs, who Vidler saw as opposing or blocking Brexit.
Vidler was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison for harassing the staff of anti-Brexit MPs.
In a voicemail message left for the MP Nick Boles, Vidler said he knew where he lived and threatened to kill him if he didn’t “keep his nose out of Brexit”.

Starmer, who is the shadow Brexit secretary, was called “a traitor”, while government minister Morgan was told that her “days were numbered”.
Vidler pleaded not guilty to harassment and to sending menacing or obscene messages over a public communications network.
A voicemail message for Gardiner said: “No deal means no deal. The only thing that will be extended is your neck.”
Some of the nine voicemail messages left for Dominic Grieve contained threats of violence and Vidler said he knew where the MP and his family lived and his schedule.
Sarah Jennings from the Crown Prosecution Service said that Vidler’s “actions went far beyond than just expressing his opinion”.
“Staff felt alarmed by what he said and took his comments as threats against the MPs,” she said.
Alongside his 18-week sentence, Vidler was also ordered to pay £300 in costs and was made the subject of a criminal behaviour order preventing him from contacting any MP except his own.

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-cameron-second-referendum-cant-be-ruled-out-4809261-Sep2019/,"FORMER BRITISH PRIME Minister David Cameron has said that a second Brexit referendum cannot be ruled out.
In an interview with The Times, the former PM said he thinks about 2016′s referendum result “every day” and accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson and MP Michael Gove of behaving “appallingly” during the referendum campaign.
“Every single day I think about it, the referendum and the fact that we lost and the consequences and the things that could have been done differently, and I worry desperately about what is going to happen next,” Cameron said.
“I think we can get to a situation where we leave but we are friends, neighbours and partners. We can get there, but I would love to fast-forward to that moment because it’s painful for the country and it’s painful to watch.”
Cameron added in the that had no regrets about launching the Brexit referendum and accused current PM Boris Johnson of behaving “appallingly” during the pre-vote campaigning.
Cameron, who led the Remain campaign for Britain to stay in the European Union, told The Times that the tortuous negotiations were “painful to watch” and that losing office left him “hugely depressed”.
Cameron, who was PM for six years, has largely kept quiet since leaving office following the 2016 Brexit referendum.
His long-awaited memoir, ‘For The Record’, is due out on Thursday.

Cameron also said a no-deal Brexit would be a bad outcome and that he would have backed the withdrawal agreement rejected by MPs.
Britain is due to leave the EU on October 31.
Cameron told The Times that a referendum on Britain’s relationship with the EU had long been promised by politicians and that the EU issue needed to be addressed.
“The country was divided whether we should be in the EU before the referendum,”Cameron said.
“This issue needed to be addressed and I thought a referendum was coming, so better to try to get some reforms we needed and have a referendum.
“But I accept that, you know, that effort failed. I do understand some people are very angry because they didn’t want to leave the EU. Neither did I.”
Cameron also said Boris Johnson’s recent move to expel anti-no-deal MPs from the governing Conservative Party and shutting down parliament for five weeks had rebounded.
“I didn’t support either of those things. Neither do I think a no-deal Brexit is a good idea,” he said.
Cameron said a second referendum might yet take place as a way to break the Brexit impasse.
“You can’t rule things out right now because you’ve got to find some way of unblocking the blockage,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dominic-raab-raising-prospect-of-a-no-deal-brexit-before-the-referendum-4746682-Aug2019/,"
UK FOREIGN SECRETARY Dominic Raab has claimed that he brought up the risk of a no-deal Brexit in interviews before the 2016 referendum.
The politician made the statement onBBC Radio 4′s Today programmeon Monday 29 July.
In 2016, Raab was a junior minister in David Cameron’s government and a member of the official Vote Leave campaign group. He served as Brexit secretary from July to November 2018, but quit over his disapproval of Theresa May’s draft Brexit deal.
He was assigned to the position of foreign secretary and first secretary of state last month by prime minister Boris Johnson.
Raab made a large number of media appearances in the run-up to the Brexit referendum – but did the risk of a no-deal Brexit come up?
Raab was interviewed by presenter Mishal Husain on BBC Radio 4′s flagship Today programme.
Part of the discussion led to him being asked whether the 2016 referendum had given the Conservative government a mandate to take Britain out of Europe without a withdrawal agreement being passed – in other words, a no-deal Brexit.
“As unionists, we committed to respecting the democratic mandate of the referendum which applied to the whole of the United Kingdom,” said Raab in the interview.
He spoke about what the referendum had called for. Husain responded by saying that it hadnotcalled for a no-deal exit.
“We made clear – those on the campaign – that we should strive for a good deal, but if that wasn’t available, that we should go on and make a success of Brexit, and so that was discussed,” said Raab.
Husain said: “I don’t remember that being discussed. When did you make a speech saying if we need to leave without a deal?”
“I was questioned on it by the BBC almost every time I appeared and so was Michael Gove… There’s all sorts of interviews which said thatof course we’d prefer a deal, but that there would be a risk,” Raab responded.

Raab was contacted byTheJournal.iefor comment but no response was received in time for publication.
Michael Gove was also mentioned in Raab’s statement, but for the purpose of this factcheck we will be focusing just on Raab.
In an article for theUK Daily Mailin March, Gove wrote that the UK “didn’t vote to leave without a deal”.
“That wasn’t the message of the campaign,” he said.
Dominic Raab was a member of the Vote Leave group in 2016, the official campaign organisation for leaving the EU. His committee colleagues included Boris Johnson, Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove.
He frequently appeared on television panels, wrote newspaper articles and gave quotes on Brexit and the then-upcoming referendum.
FactCheck has searched archives of British and Irish newspapers, Raab’s social media accounts, BBC radio clips and BBC TV interviews that Raab gave from the time period of 20 February 2016, when the referendum date was announced, to 23 June 2016 when the vote took place.
In all of these, no statement was found where Raab explicitly warned about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.
However, there are at least three instances where Raab briefly mentioned the potential risk of a leave vote.
A commonly discussed risk associated with a Leave vote was exclusion from the European single market which allows free trade between EU member states and four other countries.
During the 2016 referendum campaign, Vote Leave members including Dominic Raab repeatedly said the UK would be able to stay in this market if they left the EU.
An information cataloguefrom the Vote Leave websitestated that the UK would remain in the free trade zone “after we vote leave”.
Advertisement
In three interviews where Raab did acknowledge any kind of risk of leaving, he played it down as being unlikely.
In one such instance, he was questioned on the BBC TV show Daily Politics on 19 April 2016 in a debate with Chuka Umunna, former Labour MP and current Liberal Democrats MP.
Umunna said the Leave campaign’s biggest weakness was its claim that the UK could remain in the single market after exiting the EU.
“We will have all the benefits, but we will not have to pay a fee and we won’t be subject to any of the rules that come with being part of that single market,” said Umunna of the Leave group.
“No country outside of the EU has that kind of arrangement and why would the members we leave in the EU, why would they give us a deal that they haven’t even given themselves?”
In response, Raab initially dismissed this claim.
“The idea that Britain would be apocalyptically off the cliff edge if we left the EU is silly,” he said.
“There is a strong mutual interest. The only reason that we would be in trouble outside is if the EU is going to behave in an utterly vindictive, spiteful way that ran against its own interest,” he added.
He claimed that the head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and former UK diplomatic representative to the EU John Kerr said trade would remain strong with the EU.
On 21 April 2016, it was reported that CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn would warn about the potentials of a no-deal Brexit.
“It is hard to see circumstances under which the UK could secure a better set of deals on trade and investment outside the EU,” said Fairbairn.
FactCheck could find no evidence of John Kerr saying the UK would keep a strong trading relationship with the EU either. In 2013, Kerr was one of many who signed aletter in the Independentstating that the UK should remain in the EU to stay in the single market.
“On exiting the EU, we would lose not only the benefits of this free trade agreement, but all 37 already in existence,” the letter stated.
Dominic Raab walking to 10 Downing Street on Monday 29 July.Alastair GrantAlastair Grant
In an article written by Raab for The Telegraph on 23 February 2016, the MP discussed Switzerland’s trading deal with the EU.
“If the Swiss aren’t afraid to stand on their own two feet, outside the EU, why is Britain? Of course, we’d have to grasp the opportunities global free trade offers. They won’t fall into our lap. The Remain campaign claim that would take years, but it need not,” Raab wrote in the piece.
“Since the UK economy is bigger than all of those combined, and we buy £59 billion more goods and services from Europe than they buy from us, it is reasonable to expect to agree a bespoke deal for Britain.”
Speaking on BBC Radio 4′s Today programme on 2 March 2016 Rabb said: “I think we would want to go into the negotiation offering a very ambitious trade deal, but you are right to say that there are areas like agriculture and services where we might get slightly higher tariffs.”
Inparliamentary questionslater that day, Labour MP Angela Eagle said this was the Leave campaign coming clean “about the real risks involved” with leaving the EU.
“A vote to leave is a vote for higher costs and tariffs for British-based exporters to access the largest single market in the world, whether that’s higher costs for our car manufacturers or for our world-leading service sectors,” said Eagle.
Raab claimed that he was regularly questioned about the potential of a no-deal Brexit in BBC interviews. He stated that he discussed the “risk” of leaving without a deal during the campaign.
Incidents of Raab being questioned on the issue of leaving the single market were found, however his risk assessment was minimal. Most of his statements referred to the UK remaining in the single market if the public voted in favour of leaving.
He more frequently said the UK would continue to deal with the EU along with places like Latin America and Asia. He said it would be in the EU’s best interest to not put trade restrictions on dealings with the UK.
If Raab did have clearer warnings elsewhere, they cannot be found in online archives.
Verdict:MostlyFALSE
As per our verdict guide, this means: There is an element of truth in the claim, but it is missing critical details or context. Or, the best available evidence weighs against the claim.
Although Raab was questioned on the potentials of the UK leaving the single market,he never explicitly stated the risks associated with leaving the EU nor did he indicate that it could potentially leave without a deal.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-front-pages-react-4796243-Sep2019/,"LAST NIGHT, BRITISH MPs voted againstholding a general electionon 15 October.
MPs backed the government motion by 298 votes to 56 votes.
However, the required two-thirds majority (434 votes) was not met as 214 Labour Party members abstained. Three Labour MPs voted for the bill and 28 against.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson tabled the motion after MPs earlier voted in favour of a bill which, if passed in the House of Lords, will extend Brexit until at least 31 January 2020 in an attempt to avoid the UK leaving the European Union without a deal.
MPs backed the bill by327 votes to 299 votes.
Speaking after the result of the election motion, Johnson said: “48 hours ago, [Corbyn] was leading the chants of, ‘Stop the coup, let the people vote’. Now he’s saying, ‘Stop the election and stop the people voting’.”
So, as the crisis in the UK parliament rumbles on, let’s take a look at how the UK front pages reacted to last night’s developments.
The Metro runs with “He just can’t win”.

After Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was called a “chlorinated chicken” by Johnson yesterday, the Daily Mail goes with “Corbyn chickens out of an election”.

Sticking with the poultry theme, The Sun leads with “Is THIS the most dangerous chicken in Britain?”.

The Daily Mirror focuses on Johnson, leading with “Britain’s worst PM (since the last one)”.

“Boris urges ‘people power’ to force election’ leads the Daily Express.

The Times plays it straight with “Johnson blocked as MPs refuse early election call”.

The Guardian has: “Cornered Johnson suffers triple Commons defeat”.

Similarly, the I leads with “PM cornered after day of defeats in the Commons”.

And finally, The Daily Telegraph runs with “‘Hypocrite’ Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock”.

Holiday trips from Ireland to the North increased from 237,000 in 2017 to 255,000 in 2018, new figures released today from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency reveal.
In 2017, tourists from the South spent £52.5 million. In 2018, this figure rose to £62.2 million – an increase of nearly £10 million.
The total number of Irish visitors to Northern Ireland – to visit family, take a holiday or for business – stood at 591,000 – a 22.5% increase between 2017 and 2018.
However, the total number of overnight trips in Northern Ireland- which includes trips by visitors to Northern Ireland and trips taken by Northern Irish residents – did not significantly increase between 2017 and 2018, remaining at around five million.

In July 2018, Tourism NI said thattotal visitor numberswere up 7% for the first three months of 2018.
The latest figures suggest that Tourism NI’s strategy to attract Irish visitors to the North is succeeding over the long term – in 2012, there were only 188,000 overnight holiday trips by Irish visitors to Northern Ireland.
In recent years an increase in marketing funding has been used to target potential tourists across the border to Northern Ireland’s major attractions, such as the Giant’s Causeway and the Titanic Museum.
Internationally-acclaimed TV show Game of Thrones, which was filmed in Northern Ireland, has also been used by Tourism NI to attract visitors. In April, an exhibition based on the show was held in Belfast.
In February, John McGrillen, chief executive of Tourism NI – which is responsible for developing the North’s tourism –expressed concernabout the impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Irish tourism.
“We could potentially see some decrease in growth in the short-term, while some of the uncertainty is around,” he said.
“My fear, quite frankly, around Brexit is if we ended up in a no-deal scenario and that happened to tip both the UK and the Republic of Ireland into a recession. Typically, in that scenario, what you find is discretionary spend reduces substantially.”
Tourism NI has been receiving additional funding from the Department of the Economy in order to help Northern Ireland’s tourism sector cope with Brexit.
There are some health-warnings with the data. The Northern Ireland Statistics Office states in a short report released alongside the data that “users that are particularly interested in the number of visitors from ROI to use the figures with caution”, due largely to the fact that the data provided by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) could be subject to revision.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-uk-general-election-14-october-4793256-Sep2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson will seek to dissolve parliament and call a general election for 14 October if MPs pass a vote that would prevent a no-deal Brexit.
Conservative Party rebels are preparing to join with opposition MPs today and vote for a bill that will try to force Johnson to delay Britain’s departure from the European Union if he cannot strike an agreement with Brussels in the next few weeks.
The bill, tabled by Labour MP Hilary Benn, will also seek to prevent a no-deal Brexit by requiring parliament’s consent to leave without a deal.
A senior official said that if the government loses the vote, Johnson would table a parliamentary vote tomorrow aimed at holding an early election.
“The prime minister doesn’t want an election but that will be up to MPs when they choose to vote [today],” the official said.
Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, the motion to call an early election would have to pass by a two-thirds majority, but the Labour Party has already indicated that it would vote in favour of such an outcome.
An election would take place on 14 October to allow a new government to be in place before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU just over two weeks later.

Last night,Johnson said he did not want an electionand expressed hope that he could get a new deal with Brussels.

But he added that he would stick to the intended Brexit deadline of 31 October.
“We are leaving on 31 October, no ifs or buts,” he said in a defiant statement outside his office at 10 Downing Street.
Chances of deal ‘rising’
Today’s bill will seek to force the UK government to extend the Brexit deadline and seek a new agreement with the EU.
A cross-party group of MPs is seeking to change the law to potentially delay Brexit until 31 January next year.
They fear that leaving the EU with no deal could cause huge economic disruption.
But when Johnson took office in July, he promised to deliver the 2016 referendum vote for Brexit whatever the circumstances, and after talks with his top ministers yesterday evening, he made it clear that he would not move on this.
He claimed that the chances of striking a divorce deal with Brussels “have been rising” ahead of a summit of EU leaders on 17-18 October, adding that this was partly because the bloc understood he would walk away without a deal if he had to.
“I want everybody to know: there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay,” he said.
“Armed and fortified with that conviction I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October.”

Last chance
Johnson has repeatedly called on the EU to renegotiate the deal but it has so far refused, prompting both sides to ramp up preparations for a disorderly Brexit.
Many MPs are opposed to a no-deal Brexit, but they have only a few days to act.
The House of Commons returns today, and Johnson has controversially decided to suspend parliament next week for more than a month.
“We must come together to stop no-deal,” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a speech yesterday, warning: “This week could be our last chance.”
Last week, a Scottish court ruled against an attempt by campaigners to obtain an interim order – the country’s legal equivalent of an injunction – against Johnson’s prorogation of parliament, but a final hearing on their attempt will be heard today.
This afternoon, a cross-party group of MPs will seek to take control of the parliamentary timetable in order to allocate time on Wednesday to debate their draft law blocking a no-deal Brexit.
Their bill says that if MPs have not approved an EU deal or endorsed a no-deal scenario by 19 October – the day after the EU summit – then Johnson must seek a delay to Brexit.
However, the coalition behind the plan is divided.
Corbyn said that if the legislative efforts failed, Labour could back a vote of no-confidence in Johnson’s government, which could trigger a general election.

MPs now have the chance to pass all stages of the bill today. It will then go to the House of Lords. The motion prevented the delay of the debate on Benn’s bill beyond 5pm this Friday.
As a result of the vote, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he is tabling a motion for the general election because he will not accept the Benn bill. He added that he will not go along with the bill and that he does not want an election.
However, he said that if MPs vote for a delay to Brexit tomorrow, he will seek to hold an election.
Labour leader in the House of Lords Angela Smith has tabled a motion to be debated tomorrow that would make sure all stages of the Benn bill were completed by 5pm this Friday.
Boris Johnson has said that this proposed legislation intends to “chop the legs out from under the government”.
So, let’s see what spin the UK newspapers have put on Johnson’s first major hurdle as Prime Minister.
The Daily Mirror has run with “Boris loses control”.

The Sun runs with the more direct “Over to you Britain”.

The Daily Telegraph plays it straight with “Johnson demands election”.

Just like the Daily Mirror, the I goes with “Johnson loses control”.

The Daily Express takes its own take with “Parliament surrenders to the EU”.

“PM loses historic vote” leads The Times.

The Guardian runs with “Humiliation for Johnson as Tory rebels turn against him”.

And finally, the Metro runs with “Now the MPs take control”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/opw-vacant-sites-ireland-4787431-Sep2019/,"
THE OFFICE OF Public Works is sitting on more than thirty vacant sites around the country, some of which have remained idle for well over a decade.
The lands are made up of former customs posts, disused sites, and parcels of land purchased as part of the disastrous plan for decentralisation of government departments that was announced in 2003.
The OPW has five former customs posts along the border with Northern Ireland, two in Louth, and one each in Cavan, Monaghan, and Donegal.
Those are being kept while “alternative state use [is] being examined”. However, the minister responsible for the OPW Kevin Boxer Moran said they were not being retained as part of Brexit planning.
Minister Moran also toldNoteworthythere would be a renewed focus on dealing with vacant properties and sites in the months to come.
He said the OPW would first be targeting empty garda stations with a particular focus on making them available for community use.
Mr Moran was responding tolast week’s article onTheJournal.ie, which revealed that almost 100 OPW-managed buildings were lying idle around the country, some since the 1980s.
“A lot of people have been on to us about those vacant properties,” he said, “and we are going to go out again and look for other uses for them.
“I don’t like to read reports saying we leave property idle. It is not unusual for a country to have an amount of properties vacant and our numbers are quite low.
“I’ll be the first to admit I’m tired answering queries and parliamentary questions about empty buildings. I want to tackle garda stations first and we will try and find a use for them.”
He said the OPW would then look at other vacant buildings and sites, but said there were occasionally complications about why a property might be left sitting idle for an extended period of time.
The Vacant Sites
Records obtained byNoteworthyshow how ten sites remain in state hands from the ill-fated decentralisaton plan, which was introduced by Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy in December 2003.
The doomed plan was vigorously opposed by civil servants and was described by the late Garret Fitzgerald as “seriously damaging to the national interest”.
Although some state agencies and parts of government departments did end up leaving Dublin, most remained and the OPW was left with a portfolio of property for which they had no use.
Of the ten sites – all of which were purchased between 2006 and 2008 – the OPW has said that “alternative state use” are being examined for five while two are being prepared for disposal.
The other three, in Thurles, Thomastown, and Dungarvan are being transferred to Tipperary County Council, Kilkenny County Council, and Waterford council respectively.
In some cases, parts of the site have already been put to use like in Waterford City where some of the land was used to build the city’s new courthouse.
Minister of State Moran said all of the decentralisation sites would be offered to the Department of Housing to see if they were suitable for the provision of housing.https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/637368/
If you cannot see the graphic above, clickhere.
A number of the sites were bought at considerable cost to the taxpayer with well over €20 million paid to buy them. That included prices of up to €8 million for the site in Waterford down to just €390,000 for land in Knock, Co Mayo.
However, the likely paper losses on these purchases was offset by the Office of Public Works from the sale of land in Dublin that was freed up as part of the decentralisation shake-up.
Many of these disposals went through at the height of the property boom including the sale of the two acre former veterinary college in Dublin’s Ballsbridge for an eye-watering €172 million.

Sites in Dublin
Four of the OPW’s vacant sites are in Dublin with plans in place for three of them.
A one-acre site on Hammond Lane in Smithfield has been lying idle since 2000, after being purchased for IR£4 million by the OPW.
It has been earmarked for a new Children’s Court but the plans have faced repeated delays due first to the recession and later budgetary over-runs.

Four years ago, Minister Frances Fitzgerald said the complex would be complete in 2020. The project has since stalled with the estimated cost now at €120 million while just €80 million is available in Department of Justice budgets for its construction.
The OPW is now facing the prospect of paying a vacant sites levy on the site of up to €700,000-a-year to Dublin City Council.
A second vacant site on Military Road near Heuston Station had been chosen as the location for a new Garda Security and Crime Operations Centre.
It is just the latest in a long line of plans for the 4.7 acre site, which has been empty for more than twenty years and is also listed on the register of vacant sites.
There are now also question marks over whether the current plan will be sufficiently big to cater for increased garda numbers.
The OPW also has a small half acre site on Leeson Lane near St Stephen’s Green that isbeing readied for an office development.
The site also has a chequered history with the Office of Public Works criticised in the past over demolition works there and the general maintenance of the site.
Spruce House on Dublin's Leeson LaneGoogle MapsGoogle Maps
The OPW has a fourth vacant lot in Dublin, a one acre site in Kill Of the Grange in the south of the county.
The land beside the National Rehabilitation Hospital had been intended for use as a garda station after being purchased in 2007.
However, its future is now up in the air with the OPW saying only that “alternative state use [was] being examined”.
Among the plans considered for the site were construction of a new school and discussions with both the Department of Education and the local Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council are continuing.
In an official statement, an OPW spokesman said they had not been asked by government about using the former customs posts as part of Brexit planning.
He said that the decentralisation project had been cancelled in 2011 at the height of the recession. “A decision was taken by the OPW not to dispose of the sites until market conditions improved.”
He also said that a site in Crosshaven, Co Cork, had been the subject of legal proceedings; it had also led to the dereliction of several cottages adjoining the land.
“As soon as the legal proceedings are concluded, the OPW will be in position to dispose of the cottages and site,” he said, “Cork County Council considered acquiring the properties and site but decided not to proceed with the acquisition.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/coveney-brexit-coverage-4748762-Aug2019/,"LAST UPDATE|1 Aug 2019
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that people in Ireland should be afraid of a no-deal Brexit.
Speaking to reporters in Kilkenny this afternoon, Varadkar said that Britain leaving the EU without a deal “would have very serious impacts on the economy, north and south, and on Britain.”
“It could have security implications as well and it could have constitutional implications.
“In terms of fear, I think we should be afraid of a no-deal Brexit,” the Taoiseach said.
His comments come after DUP leader Arlene Foster accused Varadkar of “project fear mark two” after he raised the idea of a united Ireland if no deal is reached between the UK and the EU.

Earlier today, Tánaiste Simon Coveney hit out at an “inaccurate, divisive” article published yesterday by the UK’s Daily Telegraph, which claimed he and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar were acting like “fools” with a “painful and embarrassing” approach to Brexit.
Reacting to the article today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said coverage such as this is “aimed at unsettling people” and is “best ignored”.
‘Despite provocation’
Tensions between the UK and Ireland governments have become more prominent since Boris Johnson became prime minister last week, with the Taoiseachfinally speaking to his British counterpart by phone almost a week later.
From the Irish side, the position is that there will be no concessions at home or in Europe on the Northern Irish backstop or other changes to the withdrawal agreement. For the British government, the position is that there must be changes to withdrawal agreement or the UK may leave the EU without a deal.

“What bothers me most is that the political leadership of Ireland is happy to be the cheerleader for these [EU] tormentors,” Arnold wrote.
Reacting today, Coveney defended Ireland’s stance in the Brexit negotiations.
“Ireland’s position on #Brexit has been fair, consistent + honest, and it will remain so, despite provocation,” he tweeted.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-brexit-boris-house-of-commons-vote-4855393-Oct2019/,"THE DUP TODAY is expected to firmly reject Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.
The party, which has proved a pivotal player in the ongoing Brexit drama, announcedearly on Thursdaythat the details on customs arrangements and the role of Stormont in determining those arrangements in Johnson’s deal were unacceptable.
Writing in the Belfast Telegraph on Friday, Foster set out the reasons for her opposition. “We were not seeking a perfect deal. It doesn’t exist. We were seeking a deal which delivered Brexit without erecting barriers to trade,” she wrote.
One thing Foster didn’t focus on was the huge compromise the party had already made in pursuit of a Brexit deal. After spending two years rejecting a border in the Irish sea, the party agreed to just that last week – a major shift from what was previously a‘blood red line’.
DUP MP Sammy Wilson was more explicit yesterday morning, telling the BBC that his party hadalready made concessionsto Johnson’s Brexit cause.
So while the DUP is promising to inflict defeat on yet another Tory prime minister today, experts warn that the events of the last few days represent a major embarrassment for the party.
The University of Liverpool’s Jonathan Tonge, who specialises in Northern Irish politics, toldTheJournal.iethat the party has been “completely stitched up by Boris Johnson”.  It’s the latest, Tonge said, in a long line of defeats for the DUP.
In July, the party had to stand by and watch as the House of Commonsbasically votedto introduce gay marriage and abortion to Northern Ireland – two things it staunchly (though perhapsless staunchlythan in the past) opposes.

“Everything they’ve touched has turned to dust,” Tonge said. “They’ve lost every battle.”
To him, the decision to come out strongly against Johnson is partly a face-saving measure. After being sidelined so publicly by the prime minister, who has said he remains confident of passing the deal, Tonge says not to oppose the agreement in parliament would mean a “loss of credibility”.
Boris Johnson had long been trying to court DUP support.Niall Carson / PA Wire/PA ImagesNiall Carson / PA Wire/PA Images / PA Wire/PA Images
The first concession, he said, was a “huge tactical mistake” that was uncharacteristic for a party often profiled as intransigent and stubborn negotiators.
But while the vocal opposition is something of a necessary tactical correction, it leaves the party lining up today among some unlikely bedfellows such as Labour and the Lib Dems.
“The fact that they’re basically now pro-remain and pro-Good Friday Agreement, you couldn’t make it up,” Tonge says.
General election
One detail included in the Belfast Telegraph piece could be read as a warning to voters ahead of the next UK general election, which seems imminent.
“It is only as a result of the strong mandate that we received at the last election that we are able to continue to have a critical role in the House of Commons,” Foster wrote.
The calculus of an imminent election is important. Newton Emerson, a commentator on Northern Ireland, said that the party is in an “atrocious position” on Brexit.
Related ReadsDUP says voting against Brexit deal 'not the end of the game'Explainer: Where has the Northern Ireland backstop gone?UK and EU agree Brexit deal after intense negotiations
“The DUP will be campaigning against their own record,” he said.
In a typical political system, this would mean voters will set out to punish the party. But with theUlster Unionist Partya peripheral force in Northern Irish politics, the options open to voters are more limited.
Emerson points to the Alliance surge of the last two elections and suggests that in the long-term, it could start to erode the DUP’s support in key seats.
“While [an increase in Alliance support] did not involve the DUP vote going down, there is a transformation of our politics at the moment,” he says.
So what next?
One former DUP official agreed that the prospect of polling day was important, but also shouldn’t be overstated. “The response would likely be the same if the election was now or in three years,” they said.
More important is the fact that the DUP backed itself into a corner – acceding to Johnson’s compromise but then falling victim to his own shift in position on the role of Stormont.
Worse still, the former official predicts that it’s unlikely “that there could be asimple majority in Stormontto leave the customs arrangements in the future”.
This leaves the long-term future difficult for the DUP. While it will not spell the end of a party that has dominated British politics for nearly three years, the sting of the last week will not be easily forgotten.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-economy-overheating-brexit-4745850-Jul2019/,"A NO-DEAL BREXIT would deliver a massive jobs hit in Ireland, the Central Bank has warned.
In its latest quarterly bulletin, the bank has said economic growth in Ireland is now expected to be 4.9% this year and 4.1% by 2020.
The unemployment rate meanwhile is projected to decline from 4.7% this year to 4.5% next year.
Those central forecasts, however, are based on a deal on Brexit being reached and a transition period coming into effect until the end of 2020.
Given the unprecedented nature of Brexit, and the uncertainties in the international trading environment, there is considerable uncertainty around potential outcomes, the regulator noted.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit from the end of October this year, Central Bank estimates suggest that economic growth would be reduced to 0.7% next year, with around 34,000 fewer jobs by the end of 2020 compared to the central forecast.
In the event that a disorderly, no-deal Brexit can be avoided, underlying economic activity is expected to perform strongly in 2019 and 2020.
The Central Bank warned that, given the already cyclically advanced stage of the economy, there is a material risk that continued strong expansion could give rise to overheating and generate sustained upward wage pressures.
“In the event that the disruption from a no-deal Brexit is avoided, there is a risk of overheating occurring in the Irish economy given that output is now at or close to full capacity,” Central Bank director of economics and statistics Mark Cassidy said.

“The uncertainties around Brexit and managing the risk of overheating increase both the challenge and importance of charting the appropriate fiscal policy path,” he said.
In this case, Cassidy said, “there may be need to provide targeted support to the parts of the economy that are most affected”.
Business uncertainty
Meanwhile, the percentages of SMEs in the Republic of Ireland being negatively impacted due to economic and political uncertainty surrounding Brexit has doubled from 21% to 42% in the past year.
That’s according to the AIB Brexit Sentiment Index for the second quarter of the year.
By comparison, 48% of SMEs in Northern Ireland admitted their businesses were now being negatively impacted by Brexit.
Meanwhile, the delays implementing Brexit are also continuing to weigh heavily on overall sentiment, with 37% of SMEs in the Republic and 40% in the North claiming the delay is having a negative impact on their business.
While just 1% of SMEs in the Republic have let go staff as a result of Brexit, 11% have postponed plans to hire new staff, according to the Index.
In Northern Ireland, meanwhile, 3% of SMEs have already let go staff while 17% have postponed plans to add to their existing workforce.
The research also shows that 40% of SMEs in the Republic that had planned to expand or invest in their businesses have since cancelled or postponed these plans while another 16% are reviewing them.
Similarly, in the North, 38% of SMEs have either postponed or cancelled investment plans while 10% are currently reviewing them.

https://www.thejournal.ie/esri-brexit-recession-4825265-Sep2019/,"THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD consider drawing up a supplementary Budget in the New Year to help cope with the effects if there’s a no-deal Brexit, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has said.
Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has already indicated the Budget will reflect a scenario where there is a hard Brexit. However, this warning from the ESRI indicates that a further revision of this Budget may be needed due to the damaging effects of a no-deal.
In its quarterly economic commentary, the ESRI said that “it is not inconceivable that the Irish economy could contract in 2020″ in the event of a no-deal Brexit next month.
For Ireland to go back into recession, its GDP would have to shrink for at least two quarters in succession. At the present moment, however, the economy is performing strongly.
The ESRI said in its commentary that the headline GDP rate forecast for this year is now 4.9%. In an estimate based on Brexit being kicked down the road again into the coming year, the ESRI said the economy is expected to grow by a further 3.1%.
Advertisement
It does warn that these figures could be skewed somewhat, with what it calls “certain internal transactions” of a few multi-national firms causing a divergence between the headline growth and the underlying output in the economy over the next year.
As well as Brexit, another risk that the ESRI highlighted is “growing evidence of a slowdown amongst some of Ireland’s most important trading partners”.
Coupled with the potential for a no-deal Brexit, it said: “These concerns make the choice of the appropriate policy mix for Budget 2020 particularly complex.
The ESRI also advises against relaxing Central Bank rules when it comes to mortgage lending.
It warns that it could create another “house price-mortgage credit spiral” if lending was made more readily available, driving house prices up and increasing debt.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-boris-johnson-phone-call-4744140-Jul2019/,"LAST UPDATE|29 Jul 2019
THE TAOISEACH AND the new British Prime Minister will speak “in the near future”, a government spokesperson has said this evening, after questions were raised about the absence of the traditional one-on-one phone call following Johnson’s move to No 10.
Although the Irish government has contacted the newly formed British government “at official level”, Leo Varadkar has yet to receive a phone call from Boris Johnson almost a week after the new British Prime Minister assumed office.
A call between the two offices is arranged when a new leader enters 10 Downing Street.
Former Taoiseach Enda Kenny spoke with Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May on her first day in office in 2013, Brian Cowen did the same on the day David Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010, while in 2007, Bertie Ahern spoke to Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown on the day he assumed office.
However, no contact has been made between Varadkar and Johnson as the threat of a no-deal Brexit intensifies following the latter’s election as leader of the Conservative Party.
Varadkartold Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin last weekthat he hoped that the two would “meet as soon as possible” to discuss Brexit, Northern Ireland and bilateral relations.
Speaking onMorning Ireland on RTÉ Radio 1this morning, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Michael Creed said he did not believe the lack of phone call was a calculated snub by Johnson.
“The UK is our nearest neighbour, it’s our closest trading partner. We will overcome the challenges of Brexit and remain on cordial terms with our nearest neighbour,” he said.
“That’s an imperative; it’s an absolute certainty.
“There will be…engagement between the Taoiseach and Boris Johnson at the earliest possible date and I’ve no doubt that arrangements are going on behind the scenes for that to happen.”

Congratulations to@borisjohnsonon his election as party leader. Look forward to an early engagement on#Brexit, Northern Ireland and bilateral relations
In a statement toTheJournal.ie, a spokesman for the Department of the Taoiseach said Varadkar would use an opportunity to speak about Brexit when he talked to Johnson.
The statement said:
Northern Ireland visit
Johnson is expected to visit Northern Ireland later this week, a situation that would normally prompt a call from Downing Street to the Taoiseach.
However, tensions between Ireland and the UK have grown since the new Conservative leader took charge last week, which has cast doubt on whether Johnson will contact Varadkar in advance of that visit.
Speaking at MacGill’s Summer School in Glenties on Friday, Varadkar said he believed that Northern Ireland would reconsider their role in the union after Brexit.
“People who are described as moderate nationalists will look more towards a United Ireland, and liberal unionists will start to ask the question where do they feel more at home, as is Britain potentially talking about bringing back the death penalty,” he said.
Those comments followed remarks by Tánaiste Simon Coveney,who took direct aim at Johnsonby describing statements during his opening speech in the House of Commons – when he implied he might oversee a no-deal Brexit in October – as “unhelpful”.
“He seems to have made a deliberate decision to set Britain on a collision course with the European Union and with Ireland in relation to the Brexit negotiations, and I think only he can answer the question as to why he is doing that,” Coveney said.
Coveney also described his meeting with the new Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith as “helpful”, after the two met to discuss the possibility of getting the Stormont assembly to function again.

THE UK HOUSE OF Lords has approved a bill that would force the government to seek a three-month extension on the Brexit deadline if there is no-deal with the EU by 19 October.
The opposition in parliament and so-called Tory rebelssucceeded this weekin getting the Benn Bill debated, voted on and passed through the House of Commons.
The bill was then sent to the House of Lords for examination and it will now proceed to royal assent – the queen’s agreement to make the bill into a law.
It is expected to be signed into law by Queen Elizabeth on Monday.

The#HouseofLordsthird reading of#EUWithdrawal6Billhas now ended. As both Houses of@UKParliamenthave agreed the final text, the bill now proceeds to royal assent.
Opposition parties earlier confirmed that had agreed to block Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s request for a snap general election until a no-deal Brexit has been prevented.
Johnson is to table a second motion to dissolve parliament on Monday, after a vote on Wednesday failed to reach the required two-thirds majority (298 ayes to 56 noes).
Yesterday Johnsonsaid yet againthat he didn’t want an election: “… But frankly I don’t see any other way. It’s the only way to get this thing moving.”
“Boris Johnson is on the run,” Plaid Cymru leader Liz Saville Roberts toldSky News.

“As parliamentarians whose priority is to stop a no-deal Brexit, our job is to make sure the Act [to stop a no-deal Brexit] – which is to be granted royal assent today or over the weekend – is put into effect and that we remain here as parliamentarians to make sure that the Prime Minister does his duty by the law.”
The Labour Party, which has wavered over whether to back a snap election, a will not back Johnson’s bid for an election, according to Reuters News and the BBC.
Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeonsaidthat an early election is “a question of ‘when’ not ‘if’ – but Johnson mustn’t be allowed to dictate the timing as a device to avoid scrutiny and force through a ‘no deal’ Brexit”.
Layla Moran of the Liberal Democratssaidthat she’s not convinced that a general election would “solve anything”. “If you really want Brexit stop, you take it back to the people with the option to Remain and you vote to remain in the EU.”
AConservative Group for Europecarried out a 10,000-people strong poll of British voters indicated that a snap election would produce another hung parliament:
The results indicated that the Conservatives would secure 311 seats (-6); Labour would win 242 (-20); the Liberal Democrats would increase their take to 21 (+9); the Scottish National Party would go up to 52 (+17); Plaid Cymru would get 4 MPs (no change); the Green Party would get 1 seat (no change); and one more would go to ‘others’.

https://www.thejournal.ie/economy-ireland-2-4688899-Jun2019/,"THE IRISH ECONOMY will continue growing this year and next despite considerable uncertainty around Brexit and deteriorating trade relations between the US and China.
That’s according to the latest economic forecast from the ESRI, which is recommending the government consider raising taxes in October’s Budget to prevent the economy from overheating.
However the think tank says this approach should not be considered in the event of a no-deal Brexit at the end of October.
The ESRI states that despite significant international uncertainty, the domestic economy is now expected to grow by 4% this year and a further 3.2% next year. These rates are marginally up on previous forecasts.
However, the ESRI warns that these growth rates are subject to the assumption that the UK won’t crash out of the EU in October later this year as a result of a no-deal Brexit.
The ESRI analysis suggests that Brexit and uncertainty in the US have already had a negative impact on the Irish economy.
It also states that the unemployment rate is due to fall to 4% by the end of next year, with evidence of wages and costs increasing.
“Given the particularly robust performance of the Irish labour market, it is clear that the domestic economy is now effectively operating at full capacity,” the ESRI states.

Taking this into account, forecasters recommend that the government run a “contractionary budget” in 2020 in order to prevent the economy from overheating.
“This could involve the Government increasing taxes in areas which would not have a distortionary impact on the labour market,” the ESRI states.
It recommends looking at increases in the areas of carbon taxes or residential property taxes and says these “could be used to reduce some of the demandside pressures which are now evident in the domestic economy”.
The report states that all this would need to be revised in the event of a negative economic shock should the UK crash out of the EU in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoesaid earlier this weekhe will have to make an “informed judgement” or guess as to whether there will be an orderly or crash-out Brexit when he presents his budget on Tuesday 8 October.
The minister is due to present the Summer Economic Statement next week. That statement, presented every June, sets out economic predictions for the country in the run up to the Budget in October.
Two different scenarios will be set out in the statement – one for the approach if there is a no-deal Brexit, and one in which a deal is agreed.
“I will be ensuring we produce a budget which is in line with our commitments that we have with the European Union and the timings in line with every other budget that I have done. What I will be doing in the Summer Economic Statement which I will be doing next week, will be outlining different economic scenarios against which Budget 2020 will be formed,” added the minister.
“So we will be looking at the kind of economic scenario the country could face if we were to be in a deal scenario or a continuation of the status quo. What I will also be outlining is if a disorderly Brexit were to occur, what then would the backdrop be for us in the preparation of a budget,” said Donohoe.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michelle-oneill-dup-sinn-fein-assembly-united-ireland-brexit-4862538-Oct2019/,"SINN FEIN’S MICHELLE O’Neill has said that the parties in Northern Ireland are “running out of road” when it comes to getting power sharing restored nearly three years after it collapsed.
The party’s vice-president has said that 13 January – the new date for when an Assembly election is scheduled for – represents a deadline for Northern Irish parties to enter talks and to ensure that power-sharing returns.
“I think we’re quickly running out of road in being able to put the institutions back together,” she said.
O’Neill, who was speaking after giving a lecture at the Institute for International and European Affairs, said that the Stormont assembly not functioning for nearly three years was not “sustainable”.
“All efforts now need to be on trying to find a resolution,” she said.
Unlike previous times when Stormont has collapsed, the UK government has not introduced direct rule to run Northern Ireland – leaving the region at a legislative standstill.

Yesterday, a sitting of Stormont backed by the DUP in response to the decriminalisation of abortion law in Northern Irelanddescended into farcewhen party after party left the Assembly chamber after a bid to block the introduction of abortion and same-sex marriage failed.
Sinn Féin had rejected the sitting. Today, O’Neill said the meeting in Stormont had “failed”.
“I believe it was a political stunt on behalf of the DUP to try to continue to deny citizens their rights,” she said.
O’Neill also warned that the DUP lacked the “bandwidth” to focus on both Westminster, where the party’s 10 MPs hold considerable sway in deciding key Brexit votes, and on Northern Ireland.
“They do not have the capacity then to deal with the situation in the North. That disappoints me. But it is the reality of the situation,” she said.
She suggested that, now that a deal has been secured with the EU, some “Brexit clarity” could help restore Stormont.
O’Neill used the speech to suggest that setting a “realistic reunification date” would allow any transition to a united Ireland to avoid the same mistakes as Brexit.
Her party had previously called for a border poll immediately in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

“All of the mistakes made during the Brexit referendum must be avoided in any national dialogue and referenda on the constitutional future of Ireland,” she said.
Comparing the possibility of a move towards a united Ireland to that of German unification, O’Neill said that the UK, the EU and Ireland should begin discussions on the issue.
She said that the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference – one of the bodies created by the Good Friday Agreement – could act as a forum for that discussion.
Ireland, she said, should create a constitution unit and appoint a minister for north-south relations to lay the groundwork for a unity referendum.
“Following a vote for reunification, agreements will be needed between the Irish and Westminster governments, setting the parameters for Ireland’s transition to reunification,” she said.
O’Neill called for a “precise timetable” towards unification following any vote.
“Brexit is a serious, direct threat to Ireland’s future political stability and economic prosperity. These challenges require new thinking and a radical and innovative response,” she said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-labour-4860204-Oct2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON IS set for a showdown with Commons Speaker John Bercow as the Prime Minister pushes for a knife-edge House of Commons vote on his Brexit deal.
Bercow, who Tory Brexiteers have accused of being pro-Remain, will rule on whether the government can bring a so-called “meaningful vote” on its plans.
If the Speaker blocks the move, focus will switch to the government bringing its Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) before MPs today, with a vote on its second reading tomorrow.
Ministers insist they “have the numbers” to push the agreement through, but the parliamentary situation appears to be on a tightrope.
Labour has made clear it will try to hijack the legislation by putting down amendments for a second Brexit referendum and a customs union with the EU.
Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer indicated Labour could even back the WAB if it was put to voters in a national poll against a Remain option.
Shadow solicitor general Nick Thomas-Symonds said that Labour MPs will call for a confirmatory referendum, adding that he thought parliament may vote in favour of Britain staying in a customs union with the bloc.
“A customs union is going to be one of the amendments that comes through and that is something that is going to have a very good chance of getting a majority,” Mr Thomas-Symonds told BBC Radio 4’s The Westminster Hour.
But, in a column for The Daily Telegraph, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said making a customs union part of any pact “would take us back to square one and render the UK unable to strike our own bilateral trade agreements around the world”.

Despite being forced by parliament to request a Brexit delay from Brussels after another embarrassing Commons defeat on Saturday, Johnson and ministers are talking up their chances of rushing Brexit legislation through.

The move came amid reports that the EU was considering offering the UK a “flexible extension” to February, allowing it to leave whenever an agreement is secured.
‘Boost to his strategy’
Johnson is striking a bullish stance as he faces another rollercoaster week in the Commons, insisting the UK will still quit the EU in 10 days.
He abandoned plans for a meaningful vote on a Saturday sitting of the Commons after suffering an embarrassing defeat at the hands of former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin.
But the PM had not suffered a loss but achieved a “boost to his strategy”, according to former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.
“For every time he is forced to take a defiant stand against the Remainers in Parliament, it only becomes clearer to the British public just who is fighting desperately and against the odds to deliver their wishes, and who is to blame for the fact that Brexit is not yet over,” Duncan Smith wrote in The Daily Telegraph.
After losing the vote, Johnson had no option but to write to European Council president Donald Tusk, as Parliament demanded, requesting a three-month extension to the end of January.
The PM did not sign the letter, and sent a second communication insisting that a delay would be “deeply corrosive” for the UK and the EU.
Labour accused Mr Johnson of behaving like a “spoiled brat”.

The DUP was reported to be considering backing Labour’s move to force a new customs union with the EU into WAB legislation.
Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs the government aimed to hold a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal today.
Bercow said he would consider whether to allow the government’s plans, but he could rule that such a vote effectively happened on Saturday and cannot be repeated so soon.
However, party chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 5 Live he wanted to engage with the government to see “where things stand”.
If the PM’s deal is amended he will have no choice but to accept a long delay to the UK’s departure from the bloc.
A government source said: “Parliament needs a straight up-and-down vote on the deal… or do they want to frustrate and cancel Brexit altogether?
“We cannot allow parliament’s letter to lead to parliament’s delay.”
The source said the WAB would need more late-night and weekend sittings by MPs.

CANDIDATES TO BECOME Britain’s next prime minister clashed over Brexit strategies during their first debate last night, but the frontrunner Boris Johnson dodged the confrontation.
The 90-minute debate on Channel 4 featured the five remaining candidates and an empty podium for Johnson, the former foreign secretary and mayor of London.
Four of the five candidates said they would seek to renegotiate the draft Brexit divorce deal agreed with Brussels even though EU leaders have repeatedly ruled this out.
The fifth, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, said he would press ahead with the current agreement even though it has been rejected by parliament three times this year in a process that has forced out the current prime minister, Theresa May.
Stewart is the candidate with the lowest number of endorsements from fellow Conservative MPs but has waged a strong campaign on social media, reaching out to centre-ground voters from different parties.
He repeatedly challenged the others to detail their own Brexit plans and accused them of “machismo”, earning rounds of applause from the studio audience for his comments.
Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who supported staying in the EU during the 2016 referendum campaign but now supports Brexit, also struck a conciliatory tone.
Channel 4 News/ YouTube
No-deal Brexit ‘deeply damaging’
The four candidates without Stewart said they would be willing to lead Britain out of the European Union without a divorce deal on 31 October – the current deadline set by the EU. Johnson has also said Brexit must happen on that date “deal or no deal”.
But Stewart said a no-deal Brexit would be “deeply damaging” and threatening self-harm in an attempt to extract concessions from Brussels was “nonsense”.
Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who resigned from the government in protest at the government’s compromises with Brussels, went further than the others in not ruling out the suspension of parliament if needed to stop MPs from blocking a no-deal Brexit.
“I’m the only candidate committed to leaving by the end of October come what may,” Raab said.

Another candidate, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, responded saying: “I will not take Britain out of the European Union against the will of parliament.”
Home Secretary Sajid Javid joined in saying: “You don’t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy.”
The debate also featured scrutiny of the candidates’ backgrounds.
Javid, the son of a shopkeeper who immigrated to Britain from Pakistan, repeatedly made references to his humble upbringing saying he was not from Conservative Party “central casting” and could be “a messenger that can appeal to the whole country”.
The presenter, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, also challenged them on more controversial issues that have come up in the campaign such as Gove’s past cocaine use or Raab’s critique of feminism and Stewart’s repeated u-turns.

Johnson in the lead
Johnson has come under fire from his rivals for giving few interviews and public appearances.
He has claimed direct bickering between Conservative candidates will be counter-productive.
Conservative MPs will hold successive rounds of voting from Tuesday to reduce the candidates to just two, then 160,000 grassroots party members will pick the winner in a postal ballot.
The victor, who will become Britain’s next prime minister, is set to be announced in the week starting on 22 July.
Johnson topped last week’s first round with 114 votes, ahead of Hunt on 43 and Gove on 37.
Raab got 27, Javid got 23 and Stewart was on 19.
The survivors of the second round on Tuesday will face a BBC television debate later the same day, which Johnson has said he will attend.

https://www.thejournal.ie/andrew-adonis-northern-ireland-4731832-Jul2019/,"LABOUR PEER AND former advisor to Tony Blair Andrew Adonis has said that he doesn’t expect the Stormont Assembly to be back up and running by October, saying that the DUP have been “past masters of evading responsibility”.
Last week, the House of Commons voted to legislate for same-sex marriage and legalise abortion if the devolved government in Northern Ireland wasn’t back by October.
The bill was voted for by the House of Lords this week, meaning that those laws will be introduced in October if the two main parties – the DUP and Sinn Féin – don’t restore the power-sharing Executive.
Speaking toTheJournal.ie, the House of Lords member said that he hoped that the bill would “re-establish the assembly and executive”.
“If the principle parties can’t re-establish the Northern Ireland executive, then parliament will legalise abortion and same-sex marriage where matters of fundamental human rights are at stake.
“I am myself a strong supporter, and was part of the majority that parliament will legislate in the autumn. It shows that Westminster is not prepared to stand by and see human rights unaddressed in Northern Ireland.”

The two parties had reached an impasse over the cash-for-ash scandal, and the implementation of an Irish Language Act – a request of Sinn Féin.
Since its collapse over two years ago, the DUP has entered into a coalition government with the Tories. This happened after Theresa May called a snap election in June 2017, in which she lost her parliamentary majority. The DUP negotiated £1 billion in funding for Northern Ireland.
When asked whether he thought the Stormont Assembly would be set up again before October, Adonis said: “I think it’s very unlikely that the DUP will want the Assembly to be reassembled before Brexit, especially as the DUP are past masters at evading responsibility on these issues.”
He said that it’s “certainly a possibility” that a Boris Johnson premiership could lead to the break-up of the union, and that Brexit is strengthening parties and organisations vying for independence.
Yesterday,Adonis spoke to an audience in Dublinon the subject of Brexit, and said that if Johnson becomes the next Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which he is likely to, it won’t change any of the options for the UK.
“He’s basically only got three choices: 1, to get a majority for Theresa May’s deal; 2, to hold a second referendum on Brexit, and 3, to call a general election.
Adonis believes that if there’s another Brexit referendum and the vote is ‘Remain’, that it will put the issue to bed for at least another generation, as other governments won’t look to put Brexit back on the agenda.
“But if the majority of people vote to ‘Leave’ again, then we’ll have an escalating crisis and an even more hardline Brexit than Theresa May’s deal. That would deepen the crisis and wouldn’t heal the division in the country.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/john-bercow-best-quotes-4806424-Sep2019/,"JOHN BERCOW IS bowing out.
After ten years of bellowing “Order!” (and, more rarely “Division!”) at his increasingly unruly parliament, he’s stepping down as House Speaker on what could be the last day the UK is a part of the EU.
Bercow is seen as an amusing quirky character within the House of Commons – and particularly for those of us outside the UK, serves as a kind of narrator who articulates our own horror at some MPs’ behaviour.
In what has become well-recognised Shakespearean-esque exclamations, Bercow has mildly insulted and chastised members of parliament in a never-ending attempt to get politicians to listen to what their rivals are sayingbeforethey retort.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
In a way, the revered House Speaker was saved and made by Brexit: previous scandals he was involved in includeludicrous chauffeur costsfor a 16-minute walk, and multiple allegations that Bercow physically intimidated some of his staff. (Bercow was also on the House of Commonscommission that agreedto change the rules so that these historic allegations can be investigated.)
His departure also comes at a particularly strategic time – just after the Tory party began discussing running another Tory candidate against him in his constituency of Buckingham. He’s also getting out before the UK leaves the EU (if there’s no extension).
Allegations
Bercow was first elected as an MP for May’s Conservative party – but once he was elevated to the role of speaker in 2009, he was moved above politics and supposed to be party neutral.
Oddly enough, he’s been accused of being biased, not in favour of his own party, but in favour of the opposition. He’s been accused of being sympathetic to Remainers and sabotaging Brexit attempts from his party’s government.
In January this year, citing hundreds of years of precedent, Bercow told parliament that the government cannot resubmit the same Brexit deal agreed with the EU last year for another vote.
In response,the British tabloids had a field day. The Daily Mail’s front page was a picture of Bercow grinning, with the headline: “Smirk that says: Brexit be damned.”
Its parliamentary sketch writer described Bercow as “the twitchy windbag at his despotic worst”, while its editorial called him a “preening egoist” and his actions a “brazen act of sabotage… detonating this bombshell at the most inconvenient and sensitive moment”.
May would later put the Brexit deal to another two votes anyway, changing the deal slightly to get around this; one vote was without the Political Declaration on the future EU-UK relationship.
In the same month, Bercow defied precedent and the advice of his clerks and allowed MPs to amend a government motion on May’s Brexit deal – he said that it could be amended but not debated on, introducing a new interpretation of the 400-year-old rules.
This was again seen as a move that was seen as being against his own party and overstepping his role as an impartial peace-keeper and Commons rule-enforcer.

Although unusual when compared to the approach of his immediate predecessors, as is stated bythis Guardian editor, this break from convention more clearly holds the government to account by those in opposition, a general sign of a healthy democracy.
This also tallies with his own ambitions in taking up the role, where he stated the reasons he was motivated:
In Bercow’s own words
Bercow, surrounded by displeased advisors supposedly after going against their recommendations.TwitterTwitter
Bercow has had his opportunities to hit back, of course: his retorts are probably what he’s best known for.
During a House of Commons debate on his decision to allow an amendment that would reduce the amount of time Theresa May had to table an alternative to her Brexit deal from 21 days to just three, Bercow was asked:
The sticker the MP was referring to said ‘Bollocks to Brexit’. Bercow’sreply was:
“There was a factual error in [his] opening remarks, I’m sure it was an inadvertent error and I mean that most sincerely, but it was a factual error.
Bercow’s wife, who has made headlines herself before, is well-known to be a Remainer, which has drawn suspicion from Brexiteers that the Commons referee isn’t as impartial as he should be.
In other instances too numerous to count, Bercow gruffly appealed for MPs to be “calm”, “Zen”, and “Buddha-like”, in an attempt to dispel the friction and rage with some humour.
One of the more well-known examples of Bercow-appreciation was a mashup of the Speaker saying “Mr Peter Bone”to the tune of Beethoven’s 5th symphony. Peter Bone himself, who has been a vocal critic of Bercow, said of his departure: “John Bercow was without doubt the best speaker in my time in Parliament.”
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
In February 2017, Bercow drew applause from his parliament when he said that he “would not like to issue an invitation to President Trump to speak in the Royal Gallery”. He continued:
He’s also battled with Boris Johnson’s government from the start – accusing Johnson’s “blindingly obvious” decision to prorogue parliament to stifle MPs debating the subject.
As parliament was being prorogued, Bercow said it was “an act of executive fiat”.
He verbally grappled with Commons Leader Jacob Rees Mogg when he tried to cite parliamentary procedure back at him, and famously this week, told the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove:
“He wouldn’t dare behave like that in front of [the school] and neither would I.”
A YouGov survey of MPs conduced earlier this year found that Lindsay Hoyle, a Labour MP and current Deputy Speaker gathered the most supportby far.
Whoever replaces Bercow will have some job ahead of them in drawing the same attention on the House of Commons, and whipping MPs into line that he did.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-dairy-industry-no-deal-brexit-4840591-Oct2019/,"THE DAIRY INDUSTRY in Northern Ireland could be “wiped out” by a no-deal Brexit, a representative body has warned.
In a stark forecast, Dairy Council Northern Ireland (DCNI) said producers and farmers face a “certain doomsday scenario” if the UK leaves on 31 October without a negotiated agreement.
The council said the industry was staring at a crisis of “epic proportions”.
The body represents major milk processors in the region, including Dale Farm, Glanbia Cheese, Glanbia Ireland and Lakeland Dairies – four companies that account for over 90% of the 2.4 billion litres of milk collected from Northern Ireland farms each year.
Dr Mike Johnston, chief executive of Dairy Council NI, said the future of 3000 farm families in the region was on the line.
“Put simply, dairy processors and their farmers will not survive unless there is a deal,” said Johnston.
He said the council had estimated that trade tariffs on both raw milk and finished products moved from Northern Ireland to the EU would cost in the region of £320 million (€360 million) a year, a burden he said would equate to a 10p (11c) per litre drop in the price paid to farmers.
He highlighted that 35% of milk collected at Northern Ireland farms is processed in facilities across the border.
Johnston expressed concern about the administrative burden of obtaining certification to transport the milk south of the border.
He said there was no capacity to process hundreds of millions of extra litres of milk within Northern Ireland.
“Based on Dairy Council NI calculations in a no-deal Brexit, trade tariffs on both raw milk and finished products moved from NI to the EU would total £320 million, before you calculate the cost of the administrative burden customs will place on dairy processors,” he said.
“This tariff represents 25% of the value of our entire industry.

“In a sector where the margin is, at best, 3% or 4%, trade tariffs of that magnitude would wipe out the industry.
On the milk processing capacity issue, Johnston added: “The dairy industry in Northern Ireland simply does not have the capacity to process all the milk produced on farms at present and we are seriously exposed.
“After maximising NI milk processing capacity, there is a processing shortfall of some 600 million litres that will not have a viable home if politicians cannot find a solution to the current Brexit impasse.
“That would be a devastating situation for the Northern Ireland dairy industry, farming families, rural communities and the Northern Ireland economy.
“If we don’t get a Brexit deal and cannot transport raw milk south, without significant delays and/or certification requirements, then our industry is facing a crisis of epic proportions.
“All processing sites in Northern Ireland will be full while there is no spare capacity to process that volume of milk in Great Britain.
“We have communicated these significant risks in the event of a no-deal to authorities in NI, the Republic and London but have not got any satisfactory outcome so far.”
Johnston added that farmers and processes are “extremely worried” about a the outcome of a no-deal Brexit.
“We are now less than 25 days away from Brexit and we are still faced with more questions than answers and more uncertainty than certainty.
“Our farmers, their families, our customers and the entire rural economy of Northern Ireland need greater security and clarity.
“Put simply, dairy processors and their farmers will not survive unless there is a deal.
“NI farmers, processors and customers need a deal to mitigate trade tariffs and enable the continued movement and trade in raw milk and finished products,” said Johnston.
SDLP MLA for Mid Ulster, Patsy McGlone said that a no-deal Brexit would be a “devastating situation” for the North.
“The positioning by the current British Government and its enablers in the DUP means that a no-deal Brexit remains a real and present danger to the Northern Ireland dairy sector,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/prorogue-high-court-belfast-mccord-4787671-Aug2019/,"A LEGAL BID to compel Boris Johnson to reverse plans to suspend parliament before Brexit has commenced at the High Court in Belfast.
Victims campaigner Raymond McCord is seeking an urgent injunction aimed at forcing the British Prime Minister to change his advice to the Queen to prorogue the House of Commons.
McCord’s lawyers claim he received assurances that no such suspension would take place ahead of the 31 October deadline for the UK to leave the EU.
They argued that the Government’s move to put parliament on hold for up to five weeks represents an unlawful attempt to thwart MPs from debating a potential no-deal Brexit.
Ronan Lavery QC told the Court today: “My client watched the events which took place yesterday on television with some dismay.
“Then yesterday happened, which seemed to be at odds with - not an undertaking - but an assurance there was nothing to worry about.”
McCord, whose son Raymond Jr was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997, is mounting a separate, wider legal challenge against any withdrawal from the EU without an agreement.
The Belfast man claims a departure on those terms would breach the Good Friday Agreement.
According to his legal team the use of prorogation is also unconstitutional, with the policy posing a threat to the Northern Ireland peace process.
With the Prime Minister pledging the UK will leave the EU on 31 October “do or die”, the judicial review challenge is listed for hearing next month.

However, the application for an injunction was lodged after Johnson announced plans to suspend parliament.
“It’s an unprecedented prorogation,” Lavery contended.
Pressed by Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan to identify an unlawful use of the power, counsel alleged an ulterior purpose.
“It’s to impede the amount of parliamentary time that is available to debate,” he said.
Adjourning the application until Friday, the judge requested amendments to the papers.
Outside court, McCord claimed a no-deal Brexit could have dire consequences.
“This could wreck the peace process,” he predicted.
“I want the court to clearly state this is unlawful, and that what Boris Johnson is doing isn’t for the good of the country, it’s for his own agenda and to try and sideline parliament.”
His solicitor, Ciaran O’Hare of McIvor Farrell, added: “As has been predicted by police, politicians and commentators, such a policy is likely to lead to economic turmoil, if not long-term recession, and medicine and food shortages.
“Indeed, the likelihood of civil unrest in the circumstances must be high, as well as a raising of sectarian tensions between groups in Northern Ireland.
“The delicate constitutional balance which has thus far been achieved, will be destroyed.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/g7-summit-biarritz-4780547-Aug2019/,"LAST UPDATE|24 Aug 2019

EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT Donald Tusk has warned that “trade wars will lead to recession, while trade deals will boost the economy” during a speech at the G7 summit of world leaders in Biarritz, France.
Leaders of the G7 club of countries are meeting in southern France today, with the burning Amazon rainforest, falling stock markets and divisions over trade and Brexit providing the backdrop to proceedings.
Speaking at a press conference this morning, Tusk cautioned that US President Donald Trump’s escalating trade skirmishes with China and Europe could force economies around the world into recession.
Tusk also said it was hard to imagine the EU bloc of countries ratifying its trade pact with South America’s Mercosur grouping as long as Brazil fails to curb the fires ravaging the Amazon rainforest.
The European Union “stands by the EU-Mercosur agreement but it is hard to imagine a process of ratification as long as the Brazilian government allows for the destruction” of the Amazon, he said as world leaders flew in for the G7 summit in the French resort of Biarritz.
Trump and other Western leaders will face protests as they arrive in the town of Biarritz, where a heavy police presence will keep them far from view.
Thousands are set to march around 30 kilometres near the coastal town to denounce leaders over their records on poverty and environmental issues.
13,000 French security forces are on duty to guard against violence, with authorities wary about anti-government “yellow vest” protesters and anarchists.
On Friday evening, 17 people were arrested and four police officers were injured in the first clashes in the village of Urrugne near a camp of anti-G7 activists, local authorities said.
The summit was already shaping up to be a divisive encounter, but images of smoke above the Amazon rainforest this week have lent it a darker mood.
“The Amazon is burning and it’s something that concerns everyone,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday in an interview with the Konbini website.
He has led international pressure on Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over the fires, telling him that France would join Ireland in blocking efforts to pass the Mercosur trade deal between a bloc of South American countries and the EU.
He has also called for emergency talks at the G7, which lasts from Saturday to Monday, aiming for “concrete measures” to tackle the crisis.
“We are going to try and mobilise everyone to raise funding for reforestation as quickly as possible,” Macron added on Friday.
In response, Bolsonaro said the fires could not be used as a pretext for possible international sanctions, adding that “some countries” will defend Brazil at the G7 summit.

Trade threat
Talks in the beach resort will also be dominated by a gloomy forecast for the global economy.
Wall Street stocks plummeted on Friday after Trump escalated a trade war with China that is seen as responsible for a global slowdown.
“We don’t need China and, frankly, would be far… better off without them,” Trump tweeted on Friday, adding that US companies were “ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China”.
His outburst on Twitter came after China imposed tariffs on US imports worth $75 billion in response to an earlier round of American measures.
But Trump hit back immediately, raising tariffs further again.
“We see trade tensions as the single most important threat to global growth,” a top EU official told reporters ahead of the G7 summit.
Trump continues to threaten European companies with trade tariffs, including Germany’s car industry and France’s wine sector.
Last month, he promised “substantial reciprocal action” after French MPs backed a new law imposing a sales taxes on US digital giants such as Google and Facebook.

Boris Johnson debut
Although the Amazon fires and trade will dominate the agenda, the G7 meeting will also be the full international debut of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
He will meet Trump for the first time as leader and is expected to discuss the UK’s exit from the European Union, which the US president has enthusiastically backed.
“My message to G7 leaders this week is this: the Britain I lead will be an international, outward-looking, self-confident nation,” Johnson said on the eve of the summit.
But though he needs Trump’s support for a free-trade deal, he is at odds with the US President on a number of issues including the Iran nuclear crisis, climate change and global trade.
“Trade tensions are unsettling the global economy,” a British official told reporters. “There are differences with the US about how to resolve global trade imbalances.”
Trump will find himself under pressure from European leaders, particularly Macron, to ease off on his policy of “maximum pressure” on Iran over its nuclear programme.
Since pulling out of the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement limiting Tehran’s nuclear programme, Trump has imposed crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy.
Macron wants him to put a “pause” on the policy, an aide said recently, which would enable talks to take place to try to find a new diplomatic solution to the crisis.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bonnie-greer-ireland-brexit-4836763-Oct2019/,"AUTHOR AND JOURNALIST Bonnie Greer has said Ireland owes nothing to the UK, during a TV debate about Brexit.
Speaking on BBC Question Time last night, Greer also said that the United States would not do any type of trade deal with the UK that would damage its long-standing relationship with Ireland.
“Oftentimes, I hear people talking about Ireland as if this country owns Ireland.
“Ireland owes this country nothing. Ireland owes this country no concessions, it owes it no quarter, it owes it nothing,” Greer said.

She added: “The United States is Irish. If anybody thinks that they’re going to get a deal through and have a trade relationship with the United States that shafts Ireland, you’ve got another thing coming. It’s not going to happen, it’s not going to happen.
Greer, who writes for the New European newspaper, said the British government needs to take the peace process in Northern Ireland more seriously during Brexit negotiations.

“The Good Friday Agreement, in spite of its rather benign name, the Good Friday Agreement is a truce.
“And it’s a truce because the United States of America and the EU sat down with this country to make it happen. We have to be much more serious about this,” Greer said, to applause from the audience.
Racism
During the programme, Greer also discussed what she viewed as “racially motivated” attacks on the Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle, saying: “It is bad being a foreigner in this country right now.”
An audience member asked her: “Why is it bad to be a foreigner in this country at the moment?”

To which she replied: “I have a friend who is Polish, she has lived here since about 2000. Her little girl was born here, she doesn’t speak Polish to her anymore on the bus or the Tube because people abuse her.”
The audience member then said: “I still disagree with the comment. Whether she speaks Polish to her daughter or not, that’s her choice.”
“She can’t speak Polish to her daughter in public because she is maligned and hassled. That’s why she doesn’t do it, and her daughter’s losing her maternal language because her mother isn’t speaking to her anymore in public,” Greer replied.

SINN FÉIN’S MARY Lou McDonald has ruled out holding a special Ard Fheis on the issue of abstentionism and the idea of Sinn Féin proxies taking Westminster seats to “stop Brexit”.
The idea that Sinn Féin’s MPs could resign their seats, trigger by-elections, resulting in anti-Brexit MPs taking their seats in Westminster in order to prevent Brexit, was floated by The Irish Times writer Fintan O’Toole this week.
The party leader poured cold water on the idea, calling it a non-runner.
In an interview withTheJournal.ieat Cabra Community Garden, where McDonald discussed climate change, Brexit, and the next general election, she ruled out holding a special Ard Fheis to ask members if they would reconsider the issue of abstentionism in the light of Brexit.
Republican abstentionism from elected office stretches back over 100 years.It is just over 30 years agothat Sinn Féin agreed to end its abstentionist policy from the Dáil by 429 votes to 161.
Thelong-standing practiceof refusing to take up seats in Westminster continues to this day, with the party running candidates on the clear policy of abstentionism.
Voters are made aware that a vote for Sinn Féin in the House of Commons means they’re voting for a candidate who will not take up a seat if elected.
All MPs must take an oath to the Queen when taking their seats in Westminster, swearing true allegiance to the monarch. Sinn Féin opts not to do this.
Talk of no-deal Brexit
As Brexit comes down to the wire and with the new British Prime Minister Boris Johnson stating Brexit will happen on 31 October “whatever the circumstances”, talk of a no-deal Brexit has been ramping up in recent weeks.

Under the unique circumstances, McDonald was asked if she would consider asking her membership at a special conference if they might reconsider the party’s policy.
“On this, no, absolutely not,” she said.
“We have an Ard Fheis every year and every part of the organisation is free to bring forward motions to that, any issue under the sun can be addressed under those Ard Fheiseanna.
“There is no appetite for us to enter Westminster,” she said, adding that the function of the Westminster parliament  is to advance British interests.
At previous Ard Fheiseanna party members have been asked to make key decisions such as electing a new party president, as well as deciding the party’s position in relation to the abortion legislation which came into effect after the referendum on the Eighth Amendment.
“In the case of Brexit, let’s be honest, it is very specifically an English case being made, and that is okay, we shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves and think we can sabotage that.”
McDonald said she did consider the argument presented by O’Toole in his recent opinion piece.
“I did consider it, I read Fintan’s piece with great interest. I always follow what Fintan has to say because he is a very interesting and incisive commentator, but he is wrong on this point.”
Sinn Féin riding in ‘on their charger’
She denied that the seven MP votes would make any difference when it comes to a vote on Brexit.
“It is not going to, the maths are established. They have decided for Brexit. Ireland, the North of Ireland, has taken a different view. Scotland has taken a different view, but this is largely an English question, and in fairness to them, they have decided their democratic future,” she said.
“Embroiling ourselves in a game of musical chairs at Westminster and fantasy politics isn’t going to help. In fairness to Fintan, it was a great exercise in creative thinking, and it was very well-intentioned.”
The full interview with Mary Lou McDonald in her constituency at the Cabra Community Garden, where she discussed climate change, carbon tax, a United Ireland and the next general election, will be published this weekend.

https://www.thejournal.ie/sammy-wilson-simon-coveney-brexit-4742855-Jul2019/,"DUP MP SAMMY Wilson has accused the Irish government of being “hysterical” and “self-centred” in relation to its reaction to recent comments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit.
Speaking to reporters in Belfastyesterday morningfollowing a meeting with new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, Tánaiste Simon Coveney described British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s comments earlier this week as “very unhelpful”.
“The statements of the British Prime Minister yesterday in the House of Commons were very unhelpful to this process,” Coveney told reporters yesterday.
“He seems to have made a deliberate decision to set Britain on a collision course with the European Union and with Ireland in relation to the Brexit negotiations, and I think only he can answer the question as to why he is doing that.”
Responding to Coveney today, Wilson said:
Wilson said the “megaphone reaction demonstrates that the blatant attempts by Leo Varadkar and co to use the Irish border as a means of undermining Britain’s referendum has backed fired on them and they know it”.
“The Irish government walked the world stage and styled themselves as the victims of British aggression. ‘Poor little Ireland’ may have worked in the past but people are growing tired of the same old tune. The game is up,” Wilson said.

‘Pandering to Ireland’s grumbles’
Prime Minister Boris Johnson entered 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister on Wednesday. In his first speech as PM, he pledged to leave the EU by the Brexit deadline of 31 October.
“The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts,” Johnson said.
“I have every confidence that in 99 days time, we will have cracked it. But do you know what, we’re not going to wait 99 days because the British people have had enough of waiting.”

In his statement today, Wilson said that “instead of pandering to Ireland’s grumbles”, the UK should be now making it clear that “in the event of a no deal, if the Irish, as they have claimed, will impose tariffs on goods coming from the United Kingdom into Ireland, then the British will be doing the same on Irish goods”.
“It’s quite clear that the Irish believe tariffs can be collected on goods travelling from Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic on the border, so there is absolutely no reason why the taxes can’t be collected on the other side without disrupting trade flows or requiring physical infrastructure,” Wilson said.
He added that “it’s very obvious that a deal which avoids the backstop is possible”.
“Ireland’s own admission that it will not be imposing a physical infrastructure in the event of no deal, demonstrates there is no chance of a hard border being required or even happening,” Wilson said.
Wilson has called on Johnson to stick to his commitment to leaving the EU on 31 October, adding that “it’s his best chance of getting a touch of reality in Brussels and Dublin”.
He said that he will be “enquiring as to who gave the Irish Foreign Minister access and permission to use Parliament Buildings for a press conference to attack the UK Prime Minister”.

United Ireland
In his statement, Wilson didn’t address the comments made by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in relation to a United Ireland yesterday.
Varadkarsaid yesterdaythat if Johnson wants a deal, he will have to go back on some of the comments he’s made this week, particularly in relation to the backstop.
Speaking at MacGill’s Summer School in the Glenties, Co Donegal, Varadkar said that he doesn’t know whether there will be a United Ireland in his lifetime, but has said that he thinks that those in Northern Ireland will reconsider their role in the union.
“I honestly don’t know – I do think that more and more people in Northern Ireland, certainly in the event of a no deal, will come to question the union,” Varadkar said.
He said that having a Green Paper or a form on Irish unity would be “provocative” in the current climate, and said that the Irish government was simply “trying to achieve the status quo” and not, as has been accused of them, “exploiting Brexit”.

Robins said that the understanding of the West Yorkshire Police was that the officers’ involvement would be “solely” about police officer recruitment.
He then said that “minutes before the speech” a briefing to the National Police Air Service and a media pool had been cancelled.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dominic-cummings-profile-4792346-Sep2019/,"Dominic Cummings leaves 10 Downing Street.PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
DOMINIC CUMMINGS, THE man credited with plotting the ‘victory’ to the unexpected 2016 Brexit vote, was chosen by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to be his top adviser in late July.
Since then, he’s rarely been left out of column inches or headlines. He’s been labelled as the Brexitmastermindwith a“Mafia-style”approach, and the most powerful unelected figure in Whitehall.
In HBO’s Brexit drama released earlier this year, Benedict Cumberbatch portrays Cummings as a tortured genius who played on the emotions of the disillusioned electorate to pivot the UK’s 2016 EU referendum in Brexiteers’ favour.
“This is an insurgence against the establishment,” theCummings charactersays. “[Our expectation is] to create the biggest political upset since the fall of the Berlin Wall.”
The 47-year-old was the director of the Leave campaign at the time, and has been praised as an innovative aide who will deliver Brexit at all costs – reforming government along the way.
Although he’s operating within the political system, Cummings has also shown utter contempt for politicians themselves. He’sdescribedthe eurosceptic European Research Group as a “narcissist-delusional subset”, “useful idiots” and a “metastasising tumour”. He’scalledformer Brexit secretary David Davis ”thick as mince” and “lazy as a toad”, and alsosaidthat “to a large extent [parliamentarians] are not particularly bright, are egomaniacs and they want to be on TV”.
These and other acid-tongued remarks have given him a long list of enemies: ex-prime minister David Cameron famously said Cummings was a “career psychopath”, despite having never met him.
Cummings’ elevation to a senior Downing Street aide was seen as a risky move at the time, with some sceptical that his uncompromising and caustic style could suit those at the heart of British government. Over a month into the job, he’s been accused of moulding the unelected role into that of a puppeteer, controlling the movements of government behind the scenes.
This weekend, this criticism came to a boil after he fired the Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid’s advisor Sonia Khan and had her escorted off the premises by armed police.

It’s been reported that Khan was accused of lying about her conversations with former chancellor Philip Hammond and his team, and after Khan’s work and personal phones were checked (after being willingly handed to Cummings by Khan, according tothe Telegraph), she was sacked on the spot.
This is being criticised as a violation of HR rules; Javid was only told of the sacking after it happened and the Met Police’s involvement is being scrutinised. A friend of Khan’s is quoted in the Telegraph as saying:
“What is Dominic Cummings’ problem?”
Background
Cummings was born in Durham in northern England to a father who worked as an oil rig project manager and a mother who was a special needs teacher. He attended a local private school before attending Oxford University, graduating in 1994 with a First in Ancient and Modern History.
A Russophile with a passion for Dostoyevsky, Cummings reportedly lived in post-Soviet Russia for three years after his graduation and helped set up an airline in the 1990s which failed after facilitating one flight.
After returning to Britain, he first cut his teeth in politics by spearheading several campaigns, including against Britain adopting the euro.

In an early sign of his take-no-prisoners approach, Cummings was made Conservative Party director of strategy in 2002, but left the role after eight months, branding then party leader Iain Duncan Smith “incompetent”.
He became special adviser to Michael Gove who was education secretary at the time, making a name for himself by developing an us-against-them bunker mentality within the department towards the rest of government.
He is said to disdain Britain’s civil service and referred to them and teachers as the “blob” during his time with Gove, based on their hostility to his reforms.

Some time after this, Cummings was chosen to lead the Brexit referendum campaign.
How does he operate?
“Dominic Cummings is the disruptor’s disruptor – he’s strategically single-minded and ideologically iconoclastic,” said Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, who featured him in his 2011 book The Conservative Party: from Thatcher to Cameron.

Opposition parties have decried Cummings’ appointment, noting that he was found in contempt of parliament in March for refusing to appear before a committee that investigated fake news during the EU referendum campaign.
Cummings then accused the committee members of having “greater interest in grandstanding than truth-seeking”.
Damian McBride, a former adviser to Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, said of Cummings’ early manoeuvres: “It all suggests a wild and unpredictable ride ahead”.
The Brexit prize
The Brexit referendum victory crowned Cummings’ reputation as a political maverick who could deliver the desired results against all odds.
The data-driven campaign used social media nimbly and was seen as reaching voters typically ignored by Britain’s main parties – something that could soon come in useful for Johnson as the likelihood of snap elections grows.
An admirer of 19th-century Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck and US fighter pilot and military strategist John Boyd, Cummings appears already to be deploying the latter’s core philosophy of trying to confuse opponents by defying expectations.
When Johnson undertook an unexpectedly brutal cabinet reshuffle, and then caused surprise by making no immediate plans to travel to European capitals, insisting that Brussels must compromise first, Cummings’ fingerprints were seen to be all over these tactics.

But it’s in Cummings’ personal blogwhere you get the greatest measure of the man; it’s a melting pot of jargon, theories, fury and ideas, a blisteringly condescending diktat of everything from political musings to lengthy treatises.
It’s also shocking in how honest and transparent it is: in June Cummings wrote that Britain’s current Brexit-fuelled political dysfunction was “a once in 50- or 100-year crisis” to be exploited:
In a postfrom May 2018, Cummings said claims that the Good Friday Agreement prevents “reasonable customs checks on trade” on the island of Ireland were “bullshit”.
“Readthe agreement. It does no such thing,” he says.
(Although customs checks and the absence of a border on the island of Ireland aren’t specifically mentioned in the Good Friday Agreement, hard custom-check infrastructure built through fields, towns and communities on and beside the border would threaten to undermine the relationships cultivated through two fractured communities over two decades.)
Cummings writes:

As we enter the final period of intense political debate in the UK ahead of the Brexit deadline, comprising everything from what is the will of the people to the unwritten British constitution, influential yet unelected figures such as Cummings should be watched closely – particularly as initial concerns of undue influence seem to have been warranted.

https://www.thejournal.ie/robin-swann-doug-beattie-ulster-unionist-backstop-brexit-dup-election-uup-4837718-Oct2019/,"ROBIN SWANN’S ANNOUNCEMENT this week that he will stand down as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party confirmed what many already knew – that the traditional party of unionism is facing an identity crisis.
Not that Swann’s tenure was a disaster. There was no major scandal that can be blamed on him – instead he simply failed to correct the party’s long spell on the periphery of unionism.
Speaking to theBBC on Friday, he blamed the party’s disastrous performance in the May European election – losing the seat it had held since 1979 – as simply a case of politics becoming too polarised.
“We fell between two stools,” he said.
But it’s an explanation that could have characterised the party’s two-decade-long decline – not hardline enough for some voters during the compromise days of power-sharing, but far from attractive as a home for liberal unionists.
The typical narrative is that it all went downhill after the Good Friday Agreement, which precipitated a dramatic decline in support for the party of Edward Carson and James Craig.
The figures reflect this too. In 1997, the party won 32.7% of the vote, compared to the DUP’s 13.6%.
By 2005, in the rocky few years before the St Andrew’s Agreement was signed, support had fallen to 17.7% – leaving the UUP with only one MP.
In 2017, things had fallen further after a brief resurgence in 2015. The party’s vote dropped to only 83,280 votes compared to the DUP’s 292,316.

The explanations are various. Some point to the party’s flexibility on controversial issues like decommissioning and the release of prisoners. Others say David Trimble and his successors took unionist voters for granted – failing to contemplate that their loyalty wasn’t infallible.
But most agree that it was in the early 2000s when things started to go awry for the party, with the loss of Arlene Foster and Jeffrey Donaldson to the DUP.
Queen’s University Belfast’s Dr Graham Walker, an expert on unionism, toldTheJournal.iethat over the last two decades the Ulster Unionists allowed themselves to be outflanked and outbid on key issues by the DUP.
“They didn’t seem to have the capacity to respond. Their psyche was the main party of unionism,” he says.
Worse, its response has too often been chaotic and confused – as if surprised that the politicking and concessions of the years since the Good Friday Agreement would cause no more than a minor tremor among unionist voters.

“It’s tried various leaders. It tried linking up to the Tories. It has tried to outflank the DUP on traditional unionist issues, but has also tried to appeal to liberal unionists. It’s all over the place really,” Walker said.
The next steps are less clear. While the SDLP and the Alliance Party have the luxury of a broader vote base – younger, in some cases more liberal – the UUP is somewhat backed into a corner by a large base of socially conservative supporters who no doubt have a broad range of views on Brexit.
Upper Bann MLA Doug Beattie is favourite to succeed Swann when he steps down next year, but South Antrim MLA Steve Aiken has also said that he’ll run.
It’s expected that the new leader will try and follow former leader Mike Nesbitt’s abortive attempt to steer the party towards the centre – remembered best for all the pre-election talk in 2017 of Ulster Unionist transfers to the SDLP.
It may yet succeed – there is certainly a niche in unionism among those dissatisfied at the DUP’s monopoly – but the problem of a confident Alliance alternative may yet hurt the party in the heartland of Belfast and Antrim.
Related ReadsBoris Johnson 'will seek Brexit extension' if no deal agreed by 19 October'Major issues remain': EU and Irish government studying Boris Johnson's Brexit planWhat are the possible sticking points in Boris Johnson's backstop alternative?
Whoever wins, there will be an immediate temptation towards the short-term gains of bashing the DUP on Brexit – and possibly tracking towards a more extreme position.
With some dissatisfaction already detectable over the party’s decision to back Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan – which would put a regulatory border in the Irish sea – the electoral payoffs are obvious.
“The UUP will be very tempted to try and make as much capital out of that as they can… and they will have to tack to a more traditional unionist position,” Walker says.
Certainly, this seemed to be the strategy Swann was following when he launched an attack on Johnson’s proposal this week.
“The Prime Minister and the DUP are fooling no-one with these proposals. This new protocol should be deeply concerning for all those who have the long term economic and constitutional welfare of Northern Ireland and its people at heart,” he said.
“This represents a road to Damascus conversion by the DUP and a very sharp u-turn on statements they made to the Northern Ireland public. The Prime Minister and the DUP were full of big talk. These proposals don’t offer them much of a fig leaf,” he added.
And yet on Friday Swann also urged the party to take a middle-ground position more generally – though without spelling out whether a more radical Brexit policy can be fused with moderate unionist policies.
It’s a strategy Walker doesn’t think could prove “sustainable”.
It’s not the only party casting around for an identity. The SDLP, for instance, has chosen to take up the“remain” mantlein the North, while also fumbling together an alliance with Fianna Fáil.
But the Ulster Unionist Party, facing the prospect of an election in the coming months, has much less time – and perhaps less energy – to carve out an identity that helps it back to the glory days of the 20th century.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-party-rally-newport-backstop-4819090-Sep2019/,"THE BREXIT PARTY is channelling people’s anger.
Riding on a wave of frustration with the UK political system and its failure (as of yet) to deliver on the result of the 2016 referendum, the party won 29 of 73 seats available to the United Kingdom in the European elections, making it the largest British party in parliament. It now has635 MP candidatesvetted for the next election.
In order to be different from its traditional rivals, the Brexit Party is in the middle of a ‘conference tour’ of cities across the UK. Today’s event was hosted in Newport, Wales’ third largest city which was once a booming port, with a prosperous coal industry.
A previous Brexit Party event held in the city during the European election got a rapturous response, and someone warned that the crowd would be rowdy. A local suggested that the appetite for the Brexit Party here is because Newport’s people feel they have been repeatedly let down by politicians who promised to represent them.
Although 52% of the Welsh population voted to leave the EU, the Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he would back Remain if a second referendum was held. Locals repeatedly say that most Welsh farmers are in favour of leaving the EU, but their politicians refuse to deliver on that mandate.
Drakeford’s name is one of many that drew boos from the crowd at the conference, which hosted around 300 people inside The Neon Theatre this Saturday afternoon. The others were Labour’s Emily Thornberry and Stephen Kinnock, and former Tory Anna Soubry.
Some people in the crowd are ardent Brexit Party fans – wearing the distinct turquoise t-shirts, and waving ‘We Are Ready’ signs when prompted. Some had brought their children, some went with their spouses. One man was wearing a ‘Make America Great Again’ cap. Others were there out of simple curiosity.
“We don’t know if this lot are different, but we hope they are,” one attendee said.
Broken trust is a theme of the event: merchandise outside of the conference hall has the slogan “Change Politics for Good”; one of the questions put to the Brexit Party leaders during the conference was whether there should be an immediate by-election if an MP defects from his or her party.
Ann Widdecombe hammered this point home again and again in her impassioned speech that gripped the audience, triggering cries of approval and laughter in equal measure.
“The nation voted to leave,” she said. “It didn’t vote to stand there with one leg in and one leg out.”
Earlier this year, Widdecombe drew sharp criticism on herself, when making a similarly emotive plea in the European Parliament, she compared the UK leaving the European Union to“slaves” rising up “against their owners”.

Today, she accused politicians of trying to “water down” the Leave vote; later, Welsh MEP James Wells made a somewhat Shakespearean reference to the “charlatans presiding over this rotting corpse of a democracy”. The crowd loved it, and cheered back.
Here’s Nigel Farage
The Brexit Party’s founder and leader is Nigel Farage of course, who also founded and led Ukip previously; resigning from the party the day after the Brexit vote in June 2016, and leaving the party entirely in 2018 due to its “fixation” on Islamophobia.
Because of this link and because both draw similar voters and candidates, the two parties have been likened to one another often (in fact, Ukip’s conference was also held in Newport today, just hours before the Brexit Party’s and at a different venue). The party’s critics accuse the Brexit Party of being a second Ukip; though a spokesperson denied this to be the case.
Ahead of Nigel Farage’s arrival on stage today, Richard Tice (MEP and Brexit Party second-in-command) illustrated the problems with the Withdrawal Agreement by using the word ‘PRISON’, and using the first letter of each word to spell out a problem.
By the time he read out ‘N’ (which stood for ‘Not Brexit, but a prison with no key), a pillar for each letter/problem had been placed around him. He then broke through the pillars at the end, much to the audience’s enjoyment.

Heavyweight Brexiteer Farage subsequently took to the stage, with 20 of the Brexit Party’s Welsh MP candidates lining up behind him.
In his speech, he decried those who “talked down to or humiliated” the UK, said that he wanted no part of a “new European empire” that would “snuff out and crush our nation state democracy”.
He also made pointed remarks about specific figures – referred to those protesting against UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson as the “baying mob”, calling the Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel “that little guy”, and saying that although we needed to respect those with different political opinions to our own, that sentiment “doesn’t apply to Guy Verhofstadt” – a Belgian MEP who has been forcefully critical of Brexit and the UK government.
The backstop is almost a peripheral issue to these political grievances – although Farage is the only one to bring the divisive mechanism for avoiding a hard Irish border up in his speech, it’sa common perceptionamong Brexiteers that the backstop is a cunning EU trick to stop the UK from leaving.
As Farage told the crowd today:
“He’s boxed us in! He’s boxed us in! Mrs May accepted the principle of the backstop, and we’ve been in trouble ever since.”
All this angry enthusiastic energy is peppered with a tone of humour and goodwill. While criticising Johnson for making decisions that prompted “even his own brother” to leave the party he leads, Farage then said that that “would be difficult on anybody”, and that he has “human sympathy” for him.
Related Reads'Everybody assumes we're a bunch of hairy-ass loons': What is the Brexit Party up to?Why Brexiteers see the backstop as a 'non-story', 'irrelevant' and an EU trickChair of Brexit Party says Varadkar 'hijacked' the backstop issue, and that Irish border trade is 'irrelevant'
Later, in a reference to Ireland, Farage said:
Despite his suspicions, Farage says Barnier is a “very polite, very charming, very proper” man, and recalls an interaction with him where Farage wished “you were on our side”.
In the middle of explaining how the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker indicated that the EU’s position on the backstop could be softening because Juncker said he had “no emotional attachment” to the backstop, Farage digressed about how he found it funny that Juncker later said he had no “erotic attachment” to it.
Laughing, Farage said: “Whatever about the politics, I do like Juncker, I think he’s rather funny.”
That charming playful humour, woven with the constant lambasting of the political establishment for not delivering on the result of the 2016 referendum and the feeling that the Labour party has failed the region, results in a powerful hopefulness in the room that this time, this political party means what they say.
There’s an earnestness that appeals to the disillusioned voter: the Brexit Party is selling itself as a grassroot movement that wants to preserve Britain, and prides itself on having doctors, taxi drivers, and farmers among its candidates in the next general election.
Based oncurrent predictions, the Brexit Party is to win 14% of the vote, which, for a political party that was only registered officially 23 weeks ago, is some feat.
Bearing all that in mind, whether they’re able to retain that momentum depends on one of the final things Farage said on stage today, when he advised Boris Johnson:
“Do not think you can dupe the British people, because you won’t get away with it.”
With the trust of the working class, the vulnerable and the marginalised so damaged, the Brexit Party had best make sure it doesn’t break their trust the same way.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-deal-eu-boris-jeremy-hunt-risk-economy-jobs-4730878-Jul2019/,"A NO-DEAL exit from the EU would pose a “fundamental risk” to the competitive of the British economy, the UK parliament’s Committee on Exiting the EU has warned.
A report into the economic impact of no deal, published today, warns that a no-deal exit – a possibility seen as increasing likely given the hardline positions taken by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in the race to succeed Theresa May as Conservative Party leader – would “put many jobs and livelihoods at risk”.
The committee, which is chaired by Labour MP Hilary Benn, warns that a “managed no deal” should not be the policy of any “responsible government”.
Speaking to RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme today, Benn questioned the logic of a no-deal departure from the EU, which he said could pose “catastrophic” damage to areas such as farming.
“No-deal cannot represent the end state of our future relationship with the EU,” he said.
Yesterday’s House of Commons vote, whichsaw MPs voteto block any future attempt to suspend parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit, was pointed to by Benn as a warning to the next prime minister that whatever he wants to do “he’s going to have to go through parliament”.
The report contains stark warnings for various sectors of the UK economy, including the services industry, the motor sector and farming.

In terms of business services, the committee warns that “UK’s position as the clear front-runner destination for venture capital investment in technology firms—an area seen as a future growth sector—will be jeopardised by a no deal exit”, while also noting that the lack of future certainty on the UK-EU relationship is preventing many smaller businesses from preparing for no-deal.
In terms of farming, the report warns that food supplies could be interrupted under a no-deal scenario and could pose “disastrous” consequences for farmers.
Boris Johnson – the likely winner of the Conservative Party leadership race – has said he will take the UK out of the EU by 31 October whether or not a deal is reached.
The report also questions the idea that the UK could rely on Article 24 of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which Johnson has suggested could be used to maintain free trade in the event of no-deal.
“Article XXIV is the GATT provision that allows for an interim agreement between two parties in anticipation of a free trade agreement or customs union.
“It requires an agreement between the two parties, a plan as to how the end state will be reached, and for this agreement to be notified to all parties to the WTO. By definition, leaving without a deal means there is no agreement. Article XXIV does not provide a means to mitigate the risks to EU-UK trade in the event of a no deal exit,” the report finds.
Earlier this month, Tánaiste Simon Coveney warned that a risk of no-deal was “significant” and wouldpose major challengesto the Irish economy.
The committee’s report does reference the close economic relationship between Ireland and the UK. Discussing the agricultural links between Ireland and the UK, it states: “A no deal, non-cooperative relationship cannot be the desired end state for UK-EU economic relations. The closeness of the economic relationship is most evident in the agri-food sector on the island of Ireland.”
“Northern Irish milk products would no longer be certified to cross the border to be processed, putting the continued business of Northern Irish milk producers at risk,” the report warns.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-tax-on-alcohol-and-cigarettes-for-uk-in-event-of-no-deal-brexit-4802698-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|10 Sep 2019

FINANCE MINISTER PASCHAL Donohoe has this morning confirmed that Irish people will be able to shop duty-free if heading to the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
In a statement, Donohoe said that legislation had been passed earlier this year relating to Ireland’s position should the UK leave with no deal.
British Chancellor Sajid Javid’s announcement today that UK citizens returning from European Union countries will no longer have to pay taxes on alcohol and tobacco products means Ireland’s position has changed.
Donohoe’s statement read: “As the UK has today decided to apply an unrestricted Duty-Free scheme in the event that the country leaves the EU with no deal, in line with the reciprocal policy, Ireland would not in this eventuality commence the relevant legislative measure and European Union rules in relation to passenger travel from ports and airports between the EU and third countries would therefore apply from 31 October.
“In effect this would mean that excise and VAT free sales on purchases of tobacco and alcohol made at duty-free shops, subject to quantitative purchase limits, would therefore operate between Ireland and the UK.”
The British government will also forego taxes on similar products travelling in the opposite direction in an attempt to give the tourism sector a boost should the country leave the EU without a deal, finance minister Sajid Javid announced.
The EU abolished duty-free shopping between member nations in 1999, saying it was incompatible with the single market.
The government estimates that a bottle of wine purchased in an airport duty-free on the way to the EU after Brexit could be up to £2.23 (€2.50) cheaper.

At the point of leaving the EU, travellers to the UK would still be able to bring home unlimited alcohol and cigarettes if they pay duty on it in the country of origin, as is the case currently.
But they would also have the option of buying limited amounts of duty-free alcohol and cigarettes at duty-free shops in Europe, said the government.
“We want people to enjoy their hard-earned holidays and this decision will help holidaymakers’ cash go that little bit further,” said Javid.
The move was considered by previous prime minister Theresa May, when it was estimated that it would cost the Treasury between £150-£200 million (€168-€224 million) a year.
Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke said that the move would help coastal towns such as Dover, which he represents.
“This will deliver a big boost for tourism – helping our coastal communities and ferry industry after Brexit,” he told the Sun UK.
Coastal communities such as Dover had some of the highest proportions of Brexit votes in the country in the 2016 referendum.
Duty-free shopping is already permitted for travellers going to non-EU countries.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the UK will leave the EU on October 31, with or without a deal, but is currentlydeadlockedwith MPs who have passed a law that could force him to extend the current Brexit deadline.

IF YOU THOUGHT last night’s developments in the House of Commons were a little strange, wait till you hear what’s been going on today.
Here are the main things to know from the day:
The 21 Tories who voted against the government last night – including former Chancellor Philip Hammond and the grandson of Winston Churchill – were contacted this morning to have the whip removed from them (effectively suspending them from the party).
A debate took place from 3pm today on Hilary Benn’s bill to compel the UK to request an extension to the Brexit deadline.
The bill passed through two votes in the Commons today and should go on to the House of Lords tomorrow.
This all follows an unusualPMQs sessionearlier today – Johnson’s first in the hotseat – during which the prime minister referred to the leader of the opposition as both a chlorinated chicken and a big girl’s blouse.

FOREIGN SECRETARY JEREMY Hunt has weighed in on the diplomatic row brewing between the US and the UK and called the US President’s comments about British Prime Minister Theresa May and the UK “disrespectful and wrong”.
Boris Johnson, Hunt’s opponent in the race to become British Prime Minister, dodged the question during a live debate on ITV this evening, and emphasised the importance of the US-UK relationship.
Earlier today, US President Donald Trump doubled down on his previous public criticism of the British ambassador to the US Kim Darroch, calling him “a very stupid guy”.
In a series of tweets today, Trump railed against the UK’s representative after the release of confidential correspondence from ambassador Darroch, which described Trump as “inept” and his White House as “uniquely dysfunctional”.
“He should speak to his country, and Prime Minister May, about their failed Brexit negotiation, and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was handled”.
London has been scrambling to stem the damage caused by the release of the correspondence last week.

Responding to the criticism directly, Foreign Secretary Hunt tweeted at the president:
In a televised debate on ITV tonight, Johnson and Hunt were both asked to respond to the criticism from the US president, and whether they would keep Darroch in situ if they became Prime Minister.

Former Foreign Secretary Johnson evaded the question, and emphasised his relationship with the US: “I have a very good relationship with the White House, and it’s very important that we have a close relationship with the US.”
He said that Trump had been “dragged into a British political debate, which is what sometimes happens”.
He also added that the advice of civil servants “should not be leaked or commented on by ministers” if civil servants are to feel confident in carrying out their duties, adding that “whoever leaked that deserves to be eviscerated”.
Hunt agreed that the alliance between the UK and the USA was important, but said that:
When Johnson asked Hunt would he keep Darroch in place until he retires in December, Hunt said he would; while Johnson wouldn’t answer that same question, saying “I wouldn’t be so presumptuous”.
Other reaction
The British prime minister’s office, meanwhile, has called the leak “unacceptable” but also defended the work of ambassadors in providing “honest, unvarnished assessments of politics in their country.”
“The prime minister has full faith in her ambassador to Washington,” a Downing Street spokesperson said.
Trump has also further criticised May today and her handling of the Brexit negotiations with the EU.
“I told @theresa_may how to do that deal, but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done. A disaster!”
“I don’t know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool. Tell him the USA now has the best Economy & Military anywhere in the World, by far…and they are both only getting bigger, better and stronger… Thank you, Mr. President!”

BORIS JOHNSON IS coming under pressure to concede more ground to Brussels as hopes for an early breakthrough in the Brexit talks appeared to falter.
UK and EU officials will resume talks in the Belgian capital today with the prospects of an agreement in time for Britain to leave with a deal on 31 October in the balance.
Time is rapidly running out if there is to be an agreement to put to EU leaders to sign off on at their two-day summit starting on Thursday.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said “technical-level” talks between officials over the weekend had proved “constructive”.
But in a briefing to ambassadors of the remaining EU27 on Sunday in Brussels, he said that “a lot of work remains to be done”.
Earlier Johnson told senior ministers that while a “pathway” to a deal could still be seen, there was “still a significant amount of work to get there”.
In a Cabinet conference call, he said that they still had to be prepared to leave on Halloween without a deal.
And Leader of the House, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has said the government could achieve a no-deal Brexit by using European law.
“They know that it takes two to tango and any extension has to be agreed by the council,” he said onBBC’s Radio 4 Westminster Hour.
“Theresa May got an extension not through UK law, but through EU law and until the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK.
“And the remainiacs all know that, because they know that it takes two to tango and any extension has to be agreed by the council.”

The backstop
The sticking point remains the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop intended to guarantee there is no return of a hard border with the Republic.
Barnier was reported to have raised concern about the complexity of a British plan to keep Northern Ireland in the UK customs territory while avoiding the need for border controls.
There were reported to be doubts about the feasibility of the scheme which was said to involve tracking goods as they move through Northern Ireland and then determining the tariff to be paid depending where they end up.
Court action
It raised the prospect that negotiations could carry on after this week, with the possibility of an emergency EU summit at the end of the month to finally approve any 11th hour agreement.
However if Johnson cannot get a deal by the weekend, he will come under intense pressure to seek a further Brexit delay, something he has vowed not to do.
Labour however has warned that if necessary it will take action through the courts to force him to comply with the co-called Benn Act which requires him to request an extension.
Either way, the stage is set for a major showdown when the Prime Minister returns to Westminster for an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament, the first in 37 years.
If he cannot get deal he is widely expected to blame MPs for cutting the ground from under him, laying the ground for a “people versus Parliament” general election.
If he is able to get an agreement, Government sources have said they will seek to rush through legislation to ratify it in time for the promised Halloween withdrawal date.
Some opposition MPs have signalled they could support an agreement if there was a a requirement to put it to the public in a confirmatory referendum.
However Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated he had little enthusiasm for the idea.
“I think many in Parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others, might be more inclined to support it (if there was a referendum) even if they don’t really agree with the deal. But I would caution them,” he said.
Speaking to the media this morning, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said: “A deal is possible and it’s possible this month, may even be possible this week but we’re not there yet …”

Queen’s Speech
Johnson, meanwhile, is putting a crackdown on violent and foreign criminals at the centre of the first Queen’s Speech of his premiership in a bid to “restore confidence” in the justice system.
The package of 26 bills will include legislation to keep serious criminals in prison for longer, impose tougher sentences on foreign offenders who return to the UK and provide better protection for victims of domestic abuse.
They will sit alongside measures intended to invest in the NHS, strengthen environmental protections and raise living standards through increasing the national living wage to £10.50 an hour.
Ahead of the speech, Chancellor Sajid Javid announced he is planning to hold a Budget just six days after the UK’s scheduled Brexit date.
Mr Javid tweeted: “On 6th November I’ll deliver Britain’s first Budget after Brexit and set out our plan to shape the economy and deliver our infrastructure revolution.”
Responding to the announcement, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: “We expect more of the same. An electioneering stunt rather than a budget to rebuild our stalling economy and reset the direction of our country.”
With no Commons majority, it is questionable how much of the proposed legislation in the Queen’s Speech ministers can get through Parliament before a general election.
Labour has dismissed the decision to hold the speech before the Government goes to the country as a “cynical stunt” intended to lay the ground for an election.
Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: “This Queen’s Speech is farcical.
“It is just an uncosted wish list which the Government has no intention and no means to deliver, and nothing more than a pre-election party political broadcast.”

The Irish leg of his European trip was brought forward after a reorganisation of his schedule was confirmed last Friday.
He will continue his trip this week with visits to Iceland and London, where he is due to hold a meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Pence tooka stronger linethan expected on Brexit in his joint remarks with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Farmleigh yesterday afternoon – telling his host that Ireland and the EU should negotiate “in good faith” with Johnson to find a solution to the ongoing impasse.
Speaking after the two leaders held a bilateral meeting, Varadkar said in his remarks that Ireland must “stand our ground” on the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the EU and Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May.
He asked Pence, as they stood at separate podiums in front of a small army of Irish and American reporters, to “bring that message back to Washington with you”.
Pence said that while he recognised the “unique challenges” posed by the border he encouraged Ireland and the UK to work together.
He went on to call on Ireland and the EU to negotiate in good faith with Johnson to secure a deal that “respects the UK’s sovereignty”.

The Vice President has faced criticism from back home in recent days over his decision to stay in Donald Trump’s Doonbeg resort while in Ireland – a location some 290km from his main official engagements.
The use of Trump’s various properties by the president, his entourage, and officials of other governments has been the subject of recurrent criticism in the US.
California congressman Ted Lieu accused Pence in a tweet of “funnelling taxpayer money” to Trump by staying in the Co Clare resort.
Asked if Trump had asked Pence to stay there, the vice president’s chief of staff Marc Short told reporters it wasn’t “like a command.”
“I think that it was a suggestion,” Short said.
He said Pence planned to go to Doonbeg because his family was from there so Trump offered, “Well, you should stay at my place”.
Besides, he said, the Secret Service has protected the facility “so they sort of know the realities, they know the logistics around that facility”.
Pence himself said yesterday that as Doonbeg was a fairly small place, the opportunity to stay at the Trump hotel “to accommodate the unique footprint that comes with our security detail and other personnel, made it logical”.

Shannon Airport had advised passengers to allow for delays of around 15 minutes up until noon today.
A spokesperson said in an advisory issued earlier this week: “If passengers have any concerns about the departure time of their flight they are advised to contact their airline.  As always we would like to thank our valued customers for flying Shannon.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/paschal-donohoe-ireland-economy-4766798-Aug2019/,"MINISTER FOR FINANCE Paschal Donohoe has said that Ireland’s economy is “well-capable” of withstanding a no-deal Brexit.
He said that although the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was “clearly growing”, the Irish economy was prepared.
“We have an economy well capable of responding to a no-deal Brexit, approaching the challenge with more people working in Ireland than ever before… This is a shock that we have the ability to respond back to, if we need to,” he toldNewstalk’s Pat Kenny Showthis morning.
He said that if there is a no-deal, he would “kick off a whole chain of reactions” to combat the effects a no-deal Brexit would have, but added that the irish government would have to “reassess expectations”.
But Donohoe also said that “it is possible to get an agreement in the time we have available” and that “we should not be fatalistic about our ability to secure a deal”.

“With goodwill, we are capable of reaching an agreement and ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement,” he said.
The Withdrawal Agreement has been rejected three times in the space of three months by the UK Parliament. The Withdrawal Agreement lays down the terms for the UK’s exit from the EU; the future relationship, including trade deals will be in the next phase of talks, only after the Withdrawal Agreement is passed.
The Withdrawal Agreement contains the Irish backstop, which was agreed to by Theresa May during her tenure as Prime Minister, but which her successor Boris Johnson has promised to scrap, in the hope that it secure the Withdrawal Agreement’s passage through the House of Commons.
On Newstalk, Donohoe acknowledged that “there is a difference in tone and attitude” between this UK government led by Boris Johnson, and the last one.
He said that these were mainly, the last British government wanted the backstop changed, and the current government is calling for the removal of the backstop “in its entirety”.
When asked if there was room for manoeuvre around the backstop, Donohoe said that he would ask others who think there is an alternative to the backstop: “Where else in the world does this exist?”
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the trade relationship between the UK and the EU will shift from free trade and shared customs rules under the Single Market and the Customs Union, to World Trade Organisation tariffs which are the most basic trading rules.
Related ReadsWhat will a no-deal Brexit mean for Ireland?
The implied tariffs on UK to EU exports published by Paschal Donohoe previously were on meat, cereals, sugars and sweets, tobacco, processed meat and fish, dairy, eggs, honey, and flour, which all have WTO tariffs of over 25%.
Ireland’s UK imports account for24% of its total imports, which compares with the UK  making up 13% of Ireland’s total exports. The monetary value of those are narrower than expressed in percentage terms, though: imports to the UK are worth over $18.4 billion.
Customs checks would add delays and costs on goods going between Ireland and the UK.
Tariffs will hit Irish businesses that rely on exports to the UK: by 2023, there would be an estimated 55,000 fewer jobs under a no-deal Brexit and the economy will be growing at a slower rate.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-business-no-deal-brexit-4839961-Oct2019/,"STATE AID WORTH €1.5 billion over the next three years will be needed to stabilise the economy and protect jobs if the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal at the end of the month, Ibec has warned.
Prior to Budget 2020 being announced tomorrow, the business lobby group said “decisive intervention” is “needed to support vulnerable workers and businesses”.
A report published today warned that a no-deal Brexit would deliver “a major shock” to the rural economy in particular.
“Those most vulnerable to job losses are already living in areas with fewer opportunities, a lack of other viable employment and lower incomes. The companies most exposed are both capital-intensive and low-margin.
“If firms collapse in a no-deal scenario they will not be easily replaced. Decisive and far-reaching government intervention would be required to protect jobs and support vulnerable, but viable, firms from day one.
“The risk of a ‘no deal’ is imminent and action is required immediately,” Ibec Chief Economist Gerard Brady said.
Ibec has called on the government to take a number of steps to mitigate the risks a no-deal Brexit would create.

The group wants an enhanced Enterprise Stabilisation Fund, in the same vein as what was available during the height of the financial crisis in 2009, to be introduced. Ibec said this would “fund viable companies in temporary difficulty due to a no-deal Brexit, and would, by achieving a sound, robust and sustainable business plan, allow them to be financially viable in the medium term”.
New tariffs
In order to maintain jobs in “viable but vulnerable firms” where short-time work is not possible, Ibec wants the government to introduce an employment subsidy scheme, with subsidies up to €10,000 over 24 months for employees in firms in distress.
To assist with cash flow in SMEs, the government should “accelerate” the current SME credit guarantee scheme’s coverage of invoice discounting and factoring arrangements in Brexit-impacted firms, in-line with State Aid rules, according to Ibec.
The organisation said that, to help companies diversify, a new scheme for export credit insurance aimed at companies impacted by Brexit who want to diversify away from the UK, should also be introduced.
“Timing is of the essence,” Brady said, adding: “Our experience from 2009 shows that it took 10 months from agreement on a State Aid framework at a European level until companies could draw down supports.
Brady said legislation and structures need to be put in place to administer these schemes as soon as possible. He said the measures could be partly funded by new tariffs that will have to be levied on Irish imports from the UK.
Britain is due to leave the EU on 31 October, and Budget 2020 willreflect the risksposed by a no-deal Brexit.
Speaking at a Fine Gael fundraiser on Saturday night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the exact figure of the Brexit packages in Budget 2020 had yet to be settled on, but added that it will involve a “financial package to save jobs and businesses that are viable in the long term but may be vulnerable as a consequence of Brexit”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/scotland-brexit-no-deal-case-dismissal-4840844-Oct2019/,"AN APPEAL IS to be launched against a dismissal of legal action aimed at forcing the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to send a letter requesting a Brexit extension.
It comes after Judge Lord Pentland announced his decision to refuse the case today after considering arguments previously made at the Court of Session in Edinburgh.
He cited documents submitted to the Outer House which show Boris Johnson accepts he must send a letter to the EU requesting an extension to Article 50 under the terms of the so-called Benn Act.
The Outer House of the court ruled that the case against the Prime Minister had not been “based on reasonable apprehension of breach of statutory duty”.
Lord Pentland said:
But he warned that if Johnson failed to comply with the legislation, it could damage the “mutual trust” between the courts and the politicians.
Judge Lord Pentland
He stated: “I approach matters on the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the Crown for the Prime Minister or the Government to renege on what they have assured the court that the Prime Minister intends to do.”
Legal action
Businessman Dale Vince, SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and Jolyon Maugham QC launched the legal action over fears Johnson would attempt to thwart the Act.
The legislation requires the Prime Minister to send a letter to the EU requesting an extension if no withdrawal deal is agreed with Parliament by October 19.
They will now appeal against that decision at the court’s Inner House, which is expected to be heard tomorrow.

Orders sought included stopping the Prime Minister from “frustrating” the will of the Act and mandating him to send the request.
Examples of possible frustration given include asking another member state to block the extension or by sending an additional letter which contradicts the original.
Speaking outside the Court of Session, Jolyon Maugham QC said: “The Court said it has promises from the Government that the Government will send the letter mandated by Parliament and will act in a way as not to frustrate Parliament’s intention in enacting the so-called Benn Act.
“For myself, I very much hope the court is right and the Government will, as it has promised to do, abide by the law.
“But there is very real doubt in my mind that the Government will act in accordance with the law and so tomorrow we will pursue our appeal against the decision of the Outer House to the Inner House of the Court of Session.”
31 October
Boris Johnson, Downing Street sources and Cabinet ministers have all repeatedly asserted the country will leave on 31 October regardless.
However, documents submitted to the court on behalf of the Prime Minister on Friday revealed he accepted he must send the letter under the terms set out in the legislation.
It also shows Number 10 accepts it cannot attempt to “frustrate” it.
Andrew Webster QC, representing the UK Government, argued this should be enough for the court to be satisfied that Mr Johnson would comply with the legislation.
He added that imposing any orders could “ruin” the negotiating strategy with the EU.
Aidan O’Neill QC, representing the petitioners, claimed Mr Johnson’s previous statements go against what he has said to the court through the documents.
He referred to promises made by the Prime Minister that he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than send a letter requesting an extension, and that the UK will leave on October 31 “do or die”.

TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has rejected the UK’s proposals to replace the controversial Irish backstop with a series of customs posts along the border.
It was reported yesterday evening that the UK has – as part of a broader set of proposals – suggested creating a set of customs posts along both sides of the Irish border.
The UK and the EU have been at loggerheads over the backstop, which Brexit supporters say is unacceptable.
The proposals would also create a “customs clearance site” in the North that could be monitored using GPS or tracking devices on trucks.
In response to the proposal, Coveney tweeted:
Non-Paper = Non-Starter. Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govt if a#Brexitdeal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!— Simon Coveney (@simoncoveney)September 30, 2019
Non-Paper = Non-Starter. Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govt if a#Brexitdeal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!
Coveney described the so-called “non-paper” as a “non-starter” and said it was time the European Union had “a serious proposal” from the UK government if a deal was to be achieved before the 31 October deadline.
Coveney added that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland “deserves better”.
The prospect of customs posts returning to the area around the border has been one of the most recurring fears since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016.
There have been repeated warnings that infrastructure along the border could become a target for dissident violence.
‘No credible solution’
Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland today, European Affairs Minister Helen McEntee said the so-called non-paper proposal was “not acceptable to us as a government and not acceptable to the [European] commission”.
McEntee stressed that neither the Irish government nor the EU had accepted any such proposals from the UK and that time was running out with “no credible solution” emerging from the UK side.
Said McEntee: “It leaves us in a much more difficult position. The longer it goes on the less time we have. We would have expected or hoped for something later on this week.
“It’s simply not going to be acceptable. We find ourselves with just a week left. The ball is in the court of the UK like it has been for weeks and months.”

‘Utterly unworkable’
Many political figures have responded with disbelief that these were the best proposals the UK could produce, despite repeatedly being told by the EU and Ireland that a ‘hard border’ would be a threat to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: “If Boris Johnson had spent any time listening to businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, he would know that these proposals are utterly unworkable.”
The comments came after the Prime Minister said he remained “cautiously optimistic” about the prospect of a deal despite the limited time available ahead of the scheduled October 31 withdrawal date.
He said the UK side had made some “pretty big moves” towards a deal but it was up to Brussels to respond to find the right “landing zone”.
The Fine Gael Spokesperson on EU Affairs Neale Richmond told BBC Radio 4 yesterday evening that the prospect of customs checks, as proposed by the UK, were “very worrying”.
“It is additional infrastructure, it is additional checks and it is a retrograde step that brings us back to an older time that we’d all agreed we’d moved on from,” he said.
“The British government has to make serious proposals. If these are the proposals, they’re far from serious.”

She said the question now is whether Johnson is actually serious about reaching a deal. The Sinn Féin leader said any customs or checks near or on the border are not acceptable.
There is still time to reach agreement, she said, adding that now is the time for the UK to present their alternatives to the backstop.

Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokesperson Lisa Chambers said that the proposals were not a “satisfactory” alternative to the backstop.
“With 30 days now to go until Brexit we need to see sensible workable solutions that ensure no hard border on the island of Ireland,” shewrote on Twitter.
Labour leader Brendan Howlin also labelled the plans “completely unacceptable”.
“The UK is well aware that a mass of new border checks, wherever sited, breach the agreement reached with the May government to avoid regulatory barriers to trade,” Howlin wrote onTwitter.
The widespread rejection of the proposals comes after a particularly turbulent period in the UK after Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament wasdeclared unlawfulby the UK Supreme Court.
Johnson is legally obliged by the Benn Act to ask the EU for an extension if no deal is reached by 19 October.
This plan seems likely to be rejected by the EU, raising the prospect of a no-deal exit if Johnson finds a way to avoid asking for an extension. The prime minister has repeatedly said that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October.
TheJournal.iehas asked the DUP – which has opposed the backstop but supports Brexit – if the party could back the proposals. No senior member of the party has yet commented on the proposed plans.
The Daily Telegraph’s Tuesdayfront pagestory reports that Johnson had been set to reveal his Brexit plans to EU leaders “within the next 24 hours”.
Social Democrats joint leader Catherine Murphyalso rejectedthe proposal as a “non runner”.
Alliance Party leader Naomi Long, who has carved out a vocal anti-Brexit position for her party, said that she wanted the UK government to “get its act together and recognise the seriousness of this”.
She said that the proposal was “unworkable”.
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that “people in the North didn’t vote for this”.
“Infrastructure of this nature will damage our economy with no conceivable benefit. That is the price of this twisted ideology and we refuse to pay it,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/factcheck-brexit-gb-stickers-ireland-4793337-Sep2019/,"
UK DRIVERS TRAVELLING in the EU will have to put a GB sticker on their cars after Brexit, it has been claimed.
This has caused concerns that Northern Irish drivers will have to display GB stickers if travelling in Ireland or simply just crossing the border.
On the UK government website, on apage titled“Driving in the EU After Brexit”, it states: “You should display a GB sticker on the rear of your vehicle, even if you currently have a number plate which includes the GB identifier.”
The GB identifier is simply a small sticker that identifies a vehicle as coming from the UK. This is the case even though Northern Ireland is not part of Great Britain.
The advice prompted anger – and some confusion – in Northern Ireland. People pointed out that someone living in Northern Ireland would need a GB sticker for crossing the border.
I’m Irish, my car is French and there will definitely be NO ‘GB’ sticker going on my car.#stickit🇮🇪 🇫🇷pic.twitter.com/2dbJPCMbfm— Paul Maskey (@PaulMaskeyMP)September 2, 2019Paul Maskey/ Twitter
I’m Irish, my car is French and there will definitely be NO ‘GB’ sticker going on my car.#stickit🇮🇪 🇫🇷pic.twitter.com/2dbJPCMbfm
Those who identify as Irish also rejected the suggestion they might have to display a GB sticker on their vehicles.
The decision was widely reported in both Irish and UK media. The BBC, for example, led with theheadline: “GB car sticker ‘needed for UK drivers in Ireland’ after Brexit”.
International regulations on transport are notoriously complex. Issues like aviation and driving licenses have been widely researched and discussed since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 by bothBritishandEuropeaninstitutions.
The advicecoming fromthe UK government is as follows:
However, another section of the UK government website – offering advice on the flags and symbols a driver can display on their vehicle as part of wider driver and transport guidelines – alsocurrently states:
The UK AAcurrently says: “GB Stickers are compulsory within the EU unless your UK registration plates display the GB Euro-symbol (Europlates) which became a legal option from 21 March 2001.
“The Euro plate is only legally recognised in the EU; it is still a requirement to display a GB sticker when travelling outside the EU.”
So that’s where countriesoutsidethe European Union come in. The modern, international need to use some kind of distinguishing sign on vehicles detailing country of registration can be traced mainly to the 1968Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which followed and replaced the post-war 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic.
Article 37 of the Vienna convention states: “Every motor vehicle in international traffic shall display at the rear, in addition to its registration number, a distinguishing sign of the State in which it is registered. This sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate or may be incorporated into the registration plate.”
Ireland is not a signatory to that convention, but a similar rule is included in the1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, which the country did sign in 1962.
And further to that, a 1998 regulation from the Council of the European Union – a body made up ofgovernment ministers– basically superseded the 1968 convention for EU member states.
The regulation says:

Put simply, this means that the requirement for separate stickers became largely unnecessary when a country’s national symbol (such as GB) was incorporated into registration plates.
Following Brexit, it is assumed British vehicles will no longer use those EU plates, therefore introducing the need for a “distinguishing sign of the State in which it is registered”, as per those international treaties.
“If and when the UK exits the EU, the default regime of the Vienna Convention applies. If the UK were to decide to remove the incorporated sign from its plates, car drivers would have to affix separate stickers,” Ben Van Houtte, an expert on EU transport law, toldTheJournal.ie.
However, he also said: “In relation to the Vienna Convention, it does not matter whether the twelve EU stars appear on the registration plate so long as it says ‘GB’ in accordance with the layout requirements of the Convention.”
This suggests it might also depend on how EU states interpret the requirements of the convention, which still applies in theory to non-EU states that have not reached a separate agreement with the EU.
Motoring organisation RACcurrently advisesUK drivers in Ireland that they will need a GB sticker on their car if it doesn’t have ‘Euro-plates’.
Similarly, the RAC tells travellers to France: “You will need a GB sticker on your car to drive in France unless it’s equipped with EU number plates, which show the country code in a circle of stars on a blue background.”
The AA UK’s website offers the following advice on Brexit:
If there is confusion in the area, it is typically because the area is governed by both EU regulations and international law. You theoretically do require an international identifier, but simultaneously don’t if you’re a driver from an EU member state because EU law on number plates gazumped the need for separate stickers.
Gov.UKGov.UK
The approach of the UK to this complexity has been to tell motorists to fix GB stickers to their cars when travelling in the EU after Brexit.
In a questionnaire on the UK government website, UK travellers driving in the EU are warned:
How does this apply to Ireland?
Firstly, it’s important to keep in mind that this is advice from the UK government. It does not know, for certain, what approach will be taken by other countries following a no-deal Brexit.
It is in this context that the advice should be taken, with the government trying to offer the best clarity it can to British drivers travelling in the EU after Brexit. The UK Department of Transport did not respond to questions fromTheJournal.ieasking it to clarify the legal rationale for this advice.
When it comes to Ireland, which is the only EU member state to share a land border with the UK, things will get slightly more complicated after Brexit. The AA, for instance, isadvising allNorthern Irish drivers touse green cards– basically a letter from their insurance company – when travelling across the border after a no-deal Brexit.
Ireland is not asignatoryof the Vienna Convention. However, the 1998 Council of Europe regulation does apply to us and theoretically all non-EU drivers will need to display a national symbol on their car.
Does this mean that Ireland will start fining all drivers from the UK and Northern Ireland if they don’t display a GB sticker? It’s hard to say.
The onus is on Ireland to enforce such a rule. In theory, all drivers from Northern Ireland should display a GB sticker and gardaí do possess the power to ensure they do.
It remains unclear, however, whether the Irish state will want to enforce such a rule.
Speaking onToday with Sean O’Rourkeon RTÉ Radio One on Tuesday, Minister for Education Joe McHugh, who is a TD for Donegal, was non-committal when asked whether the government would require or enforce GB stickers on cars for people travelling across the border from Northern Ireland.

“The border has become so insignificant in terms of being a barrier that we can’t go back to any other means or anything physical that would prevent that movement of people,” he said during the discussion.

On the specific issue of GB stickers, he emphasised that the government wants to ensure free movement of people across the border to protect peace in Northern Ireland.
Drivers from Northern Ireland will technically have to display the sticker after Brexit. However, it remains to be seen whether there will be efforts made by Ireland to enforce this.
On the balance of probabilities, it is likely that the Irish government will not want to force Northern Irish drivers to display a GB sticker. A Garda spokesperson toldTheJournal.iethat they were “not aware of any requirement for UK drivers to display signs on their vehicle. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport may be in a better position to advise on this matter”.
The Department for Transport did not respond toTheJournal.iewhen contacted about this issue.
The situation is somewhat analogous across Europe. France, Germany, Italy or any other EU country will have to decide – together or separately – after 31 October whether or not to check for GB stickers on UK vehicles travelling on their roads.
Insurance
While the requirement to display a GB sticker is part of law – albeit an old and little known international law – it is unlikely to affect your insurance claim if you’re involved in an accident.
For Northern Irish drivers who spend a lot of time driving in the EU, the lack of a GB sticker should not impact your road-worthiness or your insurance status.
The Association of British Insurers toldTheJournal.ie:
“Not complying with traffic regulations in this context is a separate issue, that while would not invalidating your insurance could risk other penalties,” a spokesperson said.
This suggests that a GB sticker is not going to be treated as an important document for insurance purposes.
As is clear from recent days, the Brexit process is incredibly uncertain and it’s impossible to predict what could happen in the weeks ahead. However, the current UK government position is that a GB sticker will be needed by drivers of UK-registered vehicles in EU countries.
This is in the expectation that other countries will require UK drivers to display such stickers.
However, we don’t yet know how EU countries will enforce such a requirement. Ireland has not yet said it will require drivers from Northern Ireland to display a GB sticker and this prospect has already proved controversial.
As a result, we rate the claim that Northern Irish drivers will have to display GB stickers when driving in Ireland:UNPROVEN

After rejecting Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s second attempt to force a general election, parliament was suspended in the early hours of this morning.
There wereangry scenesin the House of Commons as the procedure took place. Rebellious MPs sang, chanted and attempted to block Speaker John Bercow from entering the House of Lords.

This past week saw a group of cross-party MPs seize control of the Commons to force through a bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit, veteran Tory MPs ejected from the Conservative Party and Jacob Rees-Mogg lie supine across Commons leather.

So what happens now?
MPs are due back in parliament on 14 October for what’s known as the Queen’s Speech, which officially opens the House of Commons once again.
Three days later on the 17th, EU leaders will gather for a crucial summit in Brussels. It should become clearer at this point if Johnson intends to take Britain out of the EU with a deal or without a deal.
Johnson had promised MPs a vote on his Brexit strategy scheduled for 21 and 22 October.
But, of course, there is the Benn Bill, which was passed into law yesterday. That bill is designed to extend Article 50 and prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. It would push the current Brexit deadline of 31 October to next year at the earliest.
One of the conditions of the bill is that Johnson must either seek MPs’ approval for a withdrawal deal or their approval for a no-deal Brexit by 19 October.
Neither of those seem likely outcomes.
Related ReadsCast-iron and vital, or an anti-democratic bureaucracy: what is the Irish backstop?
If Johnson has done neither of these by then, he must request a Brexit extension from the EU until 31 January 2020, the bill states.
Johnson, however, has said that he’d rather be “dead in a ditch” than demand an Article 50 extension. He has also said he’d follow the law, though.
All in all, after a week of rejections, ejections and rebellions, today is the beginning of the calm before the proverbial.
In the meantime, the Labour Party is gearing up for its annual conference which will take place in Brighton from 21 to 25 September.
Two days later on the 27th, the Conservative Party will descend on Manchester for its assembly.
Amidst all that, it’s being suggested the UK and EU could still do a deal, with the return to the table of a Northern Ireland-only backstop providing a possible solution to the impasse – coupled with an expanded role for Stormont.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-brexit-30-days-merkel-4777445-Aug2019/,"‘THIRTY DAYS TO ditch the backstop as Angela Merkel holds out prospect of new deal’
That was the headline in the Daily Telegraph (a heavily Tory-leading paper) in the wake of yesterday’sjoint press conferenceby the German chancellor and new British prime minister Boris Johnson.
Merkel’s 30-day Brexit deadline dominates the front pages in the UK today.
’30 days to do a deal’ says the Daily Express; ’30 days to solve Brexit’ says the i newspaper; while The Times leads with: ‘Germany gives Johnson 30 days to avoid a no-deal’.
Even the left-leaning Guardian headlined its piece: ‘Merkel gives Johnson 30 days to find solution to avoid no-deal Brexit’
But what did Merkel mean by her remark? Did she set Johnson a new deadline – and if so, what’s expected to happen by 20 September?
Here is today's@Daily_Express#frontpage:-@BorisJohnsonwelcomes new deadline to finally find#Brexitsolution- Proof that the older generation pays its way- Why we just can't get enough of#DowntonAbbeypic.twitter.com/qECH9UWW9g— Daily Express (@Daily_Express)August 22, 2019Daily Express/ Twitter

On the subject of finding a Brexit solution, Merkel noted that an agreement could take two years, but then she said (and these are her exact words in German):
Aber man kann sie vielleicht ja auch in den nächsten 30 Tagen finden. Warum nicht?
The Guardian translates it as: “But we can also maybe find it in the next 30 days, why not?”
But Der Spiegel (using Google translate) has it as: “But maybe you can find them in the next 30 days, why not?”
Advertisement
Literally the translation is ‘one’ can also find it (a solution) in the next 30 days.
We asked a translator for their professional input and were told that ‘man’ or ‘one’ can often translate as ‘you’ or ‘we’.
So, it could be assumed that Merkel kept it vague on purpose. One thing that is clear is she was not promising any significant movement from Europe in the next 30 days, only to listen to possible British alternatives to the backstop.
Initial reporting of Merkel’s ’30 days’ remark seized on her words as representing some new deadline – with the result that the phrase made it onto the front pages of most major papers.
ITV political editor Robert Peston said on Twitter yesterday evening that Merkel’s comment would have put likely Tory rebels on the back foot:
He noted: “Striking that Merkel has pulled rug from under ⁦@PhilipHammondUK⁩, the Gaukeward Squad and much of anti-no-deal posse by saying there is negotiation to be had in next 30 days on how to eliminate backstop. No wonder ⁦@BorisJohnsonlooks happy.”
Peston was back on Twitter today to clarify:
To be clear, I am not saying Merkel believes that@BorisJohnsoncan deliver solutions to the backstop. But in giving him his 30 days to find a solution, she allows him to claim to his sceptical colleagues that his hardball tactics are working.

So while the timeline she presented and the way she communicated it may have come as a surprise – essentially there’s nothing new going on really. Here’s how Sky News deputy political editor Sam Coatesanalysed it:
“Has Angela Merkel offered to solve Brexit for Boris Johnson within the month? No, of course not.
Merkel has come out to clarify what she said, stating that she “did not set a 30-day deadline”.
According toReuters, Merkel told a news conference in the Hague:
Related ReadsCast-iron and vital, or an anti-democratic bureaucracy: what is the Irish backstop?
Simply put, Johnson was merely being reminded of the Brexit timeline and told to bring back the credible “alternatives” that have long been mooted by London.
As of today, the two sides remain deadlocked over the backstop, which Johnson is insisting be removed from the Brexit divorce deal.
The Irish government have been asking for more detail on the “alternative arrangements” to be put forward for some time now – something Johnson acknowledged yesterday.
He has previously said that Theresa May’s government did not have a group tasked specifically with looking for alternatives to the backstop (as she had been betting on her original withdrawal deal getting through the Commons). Johnson has however set one up.
Merkel reiterated yesterday that the backstop was always a fallback, noting that the withdrawal agreement already states the backstop can be replaced if a workable alternative solution is brought forward. If that can be done over the course of years, perhaps it can be done in a month is, essentially, what she was getting at.
The problem is that workablesolutions that are acceptable to Ireland and Europe have never been produced.
While the British press has pounced on Merkel’s word the response among Irish officials to her remarks was summed up by one source as “quite relaxed”.
Merkel was essentially telling Boris “show us what you’ve got”.
The next EU summit will take place on October 17-18, with the new session of parliament in Westminster to begin on 3 September.
All parties are well aware that if there’s progress to be made there’ll need to be some shape to the plans by mid-September – so in that respect at least, there’s something in the 30 days target.
Not that anyone needs reminding, the next cliff-edge deadline remains 31 October – now just 70 days away.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-letter-4773857-Aug2019/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Aug 2019
DURING A 30 MINUTE conversation by phone with UK Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, Tánaiste Simon Coveney “conveyed disappointment” with Boris Johnson’s letter to the EU.
During the phonecall, which took place today, Coveney also “expressed concern at the lack of alternatives to the backstop”.
There has been a frosty reception to the UK prime minister’s letter to European Council President Donald Tusk, which was released last night, ahead of planned talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron.
Johnson stressed in the letter that his government wanted to achieve a divorce deal with Brussels.
“You have my personal commitment that this government will work with energy and determination to achieve an agreement. That is our highest priority,” he wrote.
Additionally today, Downing Street underlined that there will never be “infrastructure, checks or controls” at the border.
In his conversation with Barclay today, which has been described as “cordial”, Coveney reiterated Ireland’s desire to have an orderly Brexit, while also conveying disappointment at the UK government’s letter to the European Council.
The Tánaiste also stressed the importance of the commitments made by the UK in December 2017.
Coveney said that while Ireland was always open for dialogue, the negotiation was between the UK and EU and made it clear the backstop was designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the all island economy and mitigate against the damaging impact of Brexit.
The Tanaiste expressed concern at the lack of alternatives to the backstop in the letter from the UK government and repeated the need for legal certainty on the border issue.
Despite differences, the call was described by a spokesperson for Coveney as friendly, with the Tanaiste and the Secretary of State committing to stay in touch.
Reacting to Johnson’s letter today, Tusk said that the opponents of the backstop inadvertently support the re-establishment of a hard border in Ireland.

Tusk, writing on Twitter this morning, said: “The backstop is an insurance to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland unless and until an alternative is found. Those against the backstop and not proposing realistic alternatives in fact support reestablishing a border.”
“Even if they do not admit it,” he added.
Brussels says the backstop is needed as a fallback option to preserve the integrity of European trade and preserve the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.
It was included in the deal reached with the European Union by Theresa May, which was rejected three times by the British parliament earlier this year.
A spokesperson for the European Commission said that it shared the views of Tusk. Johnson’s letter, the spokesperson said, “doesn’t provide a legal, operational solution to prevent the return of a hard border on island of Ireland”.

“It does not set out what any alternative arrangements could be. In fact, it recognises that there is no guarantee that such arrangements will be in place by the end of the transition period,” they said.

Johnson continues to insist he’s ready to leave the EU on the new scheduled exit date of October 31, with or without a deal. The prime minister tweeted this afternoon:
The referendum result must be respected.We will leave the EU on 31st October.#LeaveOct31— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson)August 20, 2019Boris Johnson/ Twitter
The referendum result must be respected.We will leave the EU on 31st October.#LeaveOct31
He insisted in his letter that the backstop was “anti-democratic and inconsistent with the sovereignty of the UK as a state”.
In addition, keeping the UK in the customs union would prevent London from establishing a trade policy independent of EU rules, he said.
The EU has repeatedly stated that it is not ready to renegotiate the Brexit deal it reached with May.
A government source here said the purpose of the backstop was to preserve the status quo and that “the reality is Brexit itself is a threat to the GFA”.
A Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) spokesperson said that it was an “unalterable fact” that the issue of the backstop needs to be dealt with.
“If Europe and the Republic of Ireland are serious about ensuring and recognising that progress in Northern Ireland is founded on support from both major traditions then it will have to face the reality that the backstop is not the way forward,” the spokesperson said.
Meanwhile Sinn Féin’s vice-president Michelle O’Neill accused Johnson of “rank hypocrisy”.
“Brexit is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement and the Tories have shown a total and callous disregard to that agreement and to the democratically expressed wishes of the people of the north,” she said.
“The fact is that the British government has agreed to the backstop and Boris Johnson has voted for it himself,” she added.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke with Johnson for almost an hour yesterday evening, with the two leaders restating their positions on Brexit.
The prime minister made clear that the Common Travel Area, which predates the UK and Ireland joining the EU, would not be affected by the ending of freedom of movement after Brexit, a government spokesperson said afterwards.
The two leaders also agreed to meet in Dublin in early September, with a specific date yet to be confirmed.
Johnson meet with Merkel in Berlin tomorrow and with Macron in Paris on Thursday, ahead of the G7 summit in Biarritz at the end of the week.
Meanwhile, this evening the Tánaiste will be in Northern Ireland to meet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-brexit-impact-northern-ireland-direct-rule-4750843-Aug2019/,"SINCE THE COLLAPSE of power sharing, UK politicians have been trying to avoid an explicit return to direct rule in Northern Ireland. Now, as the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit increases, it seems that their efforts might be in vain.
The UK’s exit from the EU, set to take place on 31 October, might yet precipitate the formal suspension of the Northern Ireland assembly and the transfer of power from Belfast to Whitehall.
Talk has turned to the prospect of direct rule after the UK governmentrefused to rule outthe possibility of introducing direct rule last week, while last month the UK think-tank the Institute of Governmentreleased a reportabout preparing for a no-deal Brexit that warned: “New legislation will be needed to introduce direct rule in Northern Ireland.”
In June, the House of Commons also voted to introduce same-sex marriage and abortion legislation for Northern Ireland if devolution isn’t restored by 21 October. At the time, the DUP’s Nigel Doddssaid that it drove“a coach and horses through the principle of devolution”.
Limbo
In the years since the 2016 referendum, someconsensus has emergedthat Northern Ireland would be most vulnerable from Brexit – whether or not a deal is secured.
The backdrop to this has been the lack of an executive and the defining parliamentary role the DUP took on since the 2017 UK general election, when it was needed to prop up the Conservative government.
Even as far back as early 2018, then-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Karen Bradley said that “things in Northern Ireland cannot simply remain in a state of limbo”.
Yet that is how things have remained ever since, as Boris Johnsonwas remindedduring his visit to Northern Ireland last week when he met with the five main political parties to discuss a potential return to power sharing.
For the last two and a half years, civil servants have been doing the little they’re legally allowed to do to administer Northern Ireland, as the rest of the population watches and waits for Sinn Féin and the DUP to reach some kind of agreement.
But now, with only a few months to go until Brexit and Johnsonupping tensionswith Ireland and the EU, the reality of no-deal is forcing the hand of politicians in London.
This has made direct rule – and all the historical and political baggage that entails – close to an inevitability. The reality, that Northern Ireland does not have the decision-making capacity to cope with the challenges of a no-deal Brexit, means that parliament is going to have to intervene.
Discussing Northern Ireland and Brexit, David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy, told a House of Commons committeelast monththat “decisions that might have to be taken would be of a much higher order and they would require much more explicit powers of direction”.
Nothing so concrete has so far been admitted by Johnson or the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith.
The University of Liverpool’s Sean Haughey, who has studied Northern Ireland extensively, is not optimistic that direct rule can be avoided in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU.
“What we have now is basically direct-rule lite – civil servants fixing the biggest leaks in the roof,” Haughey said.
Advertisement
But once the devolved governments of the UK are forced to regulate for themselves the various areas formerly under the auspices of the EU, things will get slightly more complex.
When it came to Northern Ireland, “it would break the civil service if they were expected to deal with these competences,” Haughey warned.
“If it’s a no deal, direct rule becomes essential. It would be preferable to the situation we have at the present.”
Direct rule of Northern Ireland is not an alien concept – the last experience of it was in 2007, after disagreements between Sinn Féin and the DUP in 2002 produced several years of deadlock. Yet it still remains a controversial and unpopular move among nationalists in particular.
Yet Haughey argues that, once the impact of no-deal is felt, pragmatism might trump principled opposition. “Direct rule is unpalatable, partly to nationalists, because we haven’t seen the consequences of Brexit.”
After 31 October, he predicts a “bottom-up” demand for direct rule.

Yet predictions are difficult, in part because “direct rule” can mean a variety of different things.
In previous incarnations of direct rule, all powers were transferred to London – but that doesn’t necessarily need to be the case. If the government wanted, it could retain some administrative power in some areas of the Northern Irish civil service, such as agriculture.
Good Friday Agreement
Even more questionable is whether a return to direct rule would undermine the Good Friday Agreement.
“Direct rule would itself be in breach of the Good Friday Agreement,” University College Dublin’s Professor Jennifer Todd warned.
“You can’t go back to purely British rule,” Todd toldTheJournal.ie, suggesting that one alternative might be a system of British-Irish management similar to the model reached under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.
But she warned that “relations between the governments and their very different priorities and projects don’t bode well for co-management”.
For the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), some form of “joint authority” is the only option.
Last week, the party’s deputy leader Nichola Mallon said: “The two traditions that share this island working together in our common interest. That cannot be served by British-only direct rule. Given the fact that the British government and Irish government are full co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, there must be an enhanced role for the Irish government.”
Yet as things stand, nothing is certain. And while neither the Irish government or the British government wanted to stand over the forced return of direct rule to Northern Ireland, they’re quickly running out of options.

https://www.thejournal.ie/operation-yellowhammer-4772149-Aug2019/,"THE UK GOVERNMENT has moved to downplay Operation Yellowhammer, the secret plans for a no-deal Brexit which were leaked over the weekend.
Documentsprepared by the Cabinet andleaked to The Sunday Timesyesterday outline the challenges the UK would face in a no-deal Brexit.
Although the Sunday Times claims that these are preparations for what would most likely happen in a no-deal, Environment Secretary Michael Govesaidyesterday that this was “a worst-case scenario”.
Number 10 has pushed back against the reporting of the ‘Operation Yellowhammer’ dossier, stating that it is an older document, and insisting that steps taken since then mean the scenarios outlined are not the situation now.
However,Sky Newsreports that the no-deal dossier was dated 1 August and was presented to the first meeting of the Daily Operations Committee last month.
The UK’s no-deal Brexit plans predict shortages of food, fuel and medicines; if there are difficulties importing preservatives and packaging, this would also impact on food supplies.
There’s also a potential for fresh water shortages due to possible interruptions of imported water treatment chemicals.
Price hikes would also be likely for food and electricity, and the Cabinet plans note that this that could affect “vulnerable groups”.
Advertisement
The plans, which were drafted under Theresa May’s government, say that current measures to avoid a hard border in Ireland would be “unsustainable” which would lead to a hard border, and in turn could spark protests and road blocks.
A source quoted in The Sunday Times coverage yesterday states:
Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal planning, reacted yesterday to the report stating that it is an “old document” that only looked at “what the very, very worst situation would be”.
While he said there “will be some bumps in the road, some element of disruption in the event of no deal”, he said preparations for a no-deal have been stepped up.
Gove said:
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to make a speech later today where he will state that the UK is facing a Brexit “crisis”,according to the BBC.
Corbyn will meet other British political leaders next week to discuss tactics to prevent a no-deal Brexit.
He also is set to support calls for the House of Commons to be recalled “in the next few days” to allow MPs to debate the prospect of a no deal.
The Evening Standardnewspaper reports that Philip Hammond has denied being the source of a leak of the Government’s secret no-deal Brexit planning details after Boris Johnson blamed it on a “former minister”.
The UK government is expected to publish information about their new impact assessment of no deal in the coming weeks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-deal-4863102-Oct2019/,"TONIGHT’S HOUSE OF Commons vote is being viewed as crucial and historic in the Brexit debate – but what was it on, exactly?
All the trouble started onSuper Saturdaywhen a debate and vote was scheduled to take place in the wake of Boris Johnson securing a Brexit divorce deal with the EU against all odds last Thursday.
Johnson was aiming to get it passed in the House of Commons before the Benn Act, requiring him to seek an extension from the EU by Saturday evening, kicked in.
In September, MPs voted to back the Act compelling the Prime Minister to seek the extension if a deal hadn’t been signed off by the Commons within a day of the October EU summit ending.
But before he got to ask MPs to vote for his Brexit deal, former Tory (now independent) Oliver Letwin tabled an amendment that won the support of the majority of his MPs.
This amendment made it law that thelegislation underpinningthe Brexit divorce deal would need to be passed before a straight vote (also known as the Meaningful Vote) could be held on his deal.
The Letwin amendment was voted through, and the government then announced it would try again to table its Meaningful Vote on Monday evening.
Yesterday, however, Speaker John Bercow derailed this process when he ruled that as the matter had already been put to parliament, it couldn’t be voted on again.
Johnson’s government then proposed athree-dayschedulefor all the legislation underpinning the revised version of the Withdrawal Agreement to be debated, amended, and voted on.
The 585-page draft EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement was translated into110 pages of British legislation, which would need to be passed in Parliament by the end of this week (remember, the Brexit deadline is next Thursday, 31 October).
Advertisement
Critics had argued that this wouldn’t be enough time for the legislation to be scrutinised properly – Johnson’s supporters said that opposition to his schedule was just an attempt ensure the EU granted an extension and to delay Brexit further.
What happened tonight?
There weretwo votes held tonight.
One was on the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill – essentially a vote to allow the legislation to progress – which passed by329 to 299 votes.
This has been heralded as the first majority in favour of any Brexit deal since the process began – but it’s worth noting that this is just the second reading.MPs who are waveringon what side to take could have voted for it tonight, with the intention of voting against it on the third reading – which had initially been scheduled for Thursday.
The second vote is the big onethat Johnson lost. This was on his accelerated schedule for the scrutiny of his Brexit extension: he lost this by322 votes to 308.

After the defeat, Boris Johnson said that he was “pausing” the WAB legislation, and that it was up to the EU what happened next.
House Speaker John Bercow has said that the technical term used for the current status of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is that it is in“limbo”.

Clarifying what the order of business for the House of Commons was now that MPs had voted down the government’s plans, Rees-Mogg said that the debate on theQueen’s Speechwould continue tomorrow and conclude on Thursday, and that the House would not sit on Friday.

The Queen’s Speech lays out the government’s legislative agenda for the parliamentary session, covering areas such as justice, the environment, and taxation.
If the EU grantsan extension, which it is likely to do, it will be until the 31 January 2020, as set out in the letter sent by Boris Johnson under the Benn legislation. It had been suggested that the extension could only last a couple of weeks, to allow for parliamentary scrutiny. This longer extension gives room for a long-awaited UK election.
Labour, which has previously been reticent about agreeing to a general election too close to a no-deal Brexit threat, has said that it would back an election if the extension was long enough to allow for one.
Johnson doesn’t have unilateral power tocall an election, as he needs the support of two-thirds of the House of Commons, or at least 434 MPs. This is a requirement set out under the UK’s Fixed-Term Parliaments Act.
There would also need to be 25 working days between the dissolution of parliament following such a vote, and polling day, which is usually held on a Thursday. Since becoming Prime Minister, Johnson has already tried to call a general election, and although he won a majority, he failed to get the required two-thirds support.
At Cabinet earlier today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that there would not be a third round of EU-UK Brexit negotiations, unless there was a softening of the Brexit stance towards a closer relationship (membership of the Single Market or Customs Union, for example).
In statements given to theEuropean Parliamentearlier today, EU stalwarts Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker hinted strongly that any request for an extension would be granted, with the former saying “a no-deal Brexit will never be our decision”.
An hour after the vote ended, Tusk indicated that he would indeed recommend to the EU’s 27 heads of state that they should accept the UK’s earlier request for an extension (that’s the one sent under the Benn Act).
This would mean an extension up until the31 January 2020.
The Irish government has said previously that it would support any request for an extension from the UK, particularly to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mary-lou-mcdonald-interview-3-4757353-Aug2019/,"MARY LOU MCDONALD’s daughter was one of the students out protesting against the government’s response to what the Dáil has declared a climate emergency.
The Sinn Féin leader toldTheJournal.iethis week that her daughter has told her “in no uncertain terms that politicians need to understand that they were out protesting against the current social policies, and that things need to change”.
Thousands of students took to the streets around the world, including outside Leinster House this year, to demand change.
Standing in the middle of Cabra Community Garden, which is in full bloom, McDonald acknowledged that it is important for political leaders to be questioned about what they are personally doing to reduce their carbon footprint.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar caused outrage among farmers when he said he was trying toreduce the amount of meathe eats (something a high-level report has called for this week).
Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has saidhe is trying to walk a lotmore.
As for McDonald, she tells this publication that her “other half is a committed environmentalist”.
What Mary Lou is doing to reduce her carbon footprint
In her own household, the family is assessing its waste management, as well as fuel efficiency.
“And all of that is very good. And I think it’s important that you put that question to people like me, but we shouldn’t miss the bigger picture, which is, if we are serious about the climate emergency, then it’s actually the big, structural pieces that are going to make the big difference.
“And that’s not to let any of us off the hook. Because we are all responsible for this planet.”
However, she added that there’s very little point in urging people individually to change their behaviours when the government is refusing to deal with big industry.
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
“In Irish political life, we have the announcement of a climate emergency – fantastic. You have a series of policies set forward by government, some good, some bad – okay. And in the next breath, you have a system that suggests that the Mercosur deal is a good idea, that you puncture the lung of the world to graze beef, which you import from thousands of miles away to here. Look at that for a carbon footprint,” she said, claiming it’s an “insane” plan that benefits the German car manufacturers.
“That’s the kind of thing that’s the level at which the big changes need to happen to make the big difference,” she said.
A negative gaze on agriculture
In a week where farmers have been protesting about beef prices, hoping highlight serious concerns in the industry, the Sinn Féin leader said climate justice is not about turning a “negative gaze on agriculture”.

Carbon tax is also a non-runner for her party.

Walking through the garden, which is in her constituency, just next to the Royal Canal, she said there are two reasons she is opposed to it.
“Number one, because they don’t work,” she said, adding that “the reality is, a there is a carbon tax already here. And I know other jurisdictions where there are carbon taxes, they have not had the effect of reducing emissions. That’s the fact”.
Research from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) claims a levy could reduce emissions by up to 10%, though there arediffering academic opinionson the impact.
Putting a financial burden on households
The second reason McDonald is against a carbon tax is because the financial burden is being placed back on households rather than big industry producers.
“We have a problem with the idea that you place the burden of all of this financially back on households, lots of whom are struggling and lots of whom can’t afford to drive an electric car, lots of whom can’t do that. So why penalise people for that?”
The only way her party will have a say in such matters is if they enter government.
This week, McDonald took part in a debate with the Taoiseach, and other politicians, at Féile an Phobail. Photos emerged of the pair sitting side by side, with some reporting that their demeanor towards each other seemed more harmonious that in the past.

So, are Mary Lou and Leo on good terms right now?
“Well, yeah, I mean, I don’t think I was ever on bad speaking terms with the Taoiseach. I mean, the criticisms that we have of government extend not just to Fine Gael, but also Fianna Fáil, because they’re in this together.
“I just think that they have gotten it wrong on any number of policy issues. I believe they’ll continue to get things wrong, not least because they don’t really listen when others come forward with good propositions. They’re very locked into a particular way of seeing the world. That’s really evident on something like housing, where manifestly the policy is failing and failing and failing again, and yes, they seem to insist on pursuing failure,” she said.
Speaking about the controversial issue of co-living, which Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy has been criticised for championing, McDonald said the government thinks it is a good idea.
“I mean, you know, you really have to question how?”
Going into government with Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil
While both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have both ruled out Sinn Féin as a possible coalition partner in government, McDonald said she isn’t a fan of either party, adding neither Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil are “ideal partners” for her party.
“And it would be very difficult for us to agree a programme for a government with them, because we’re about the big picture, of a big change in health and housing, at we’re about dealing with our island’s future in a real way and in a planned way, which they’re,  resisting,” she said.
She hit out at both parties for stating that they would not speak to Sinn Fein after the next general election result, calling it “undemocratic”.
McDonald said for both party leaders to say that any party, such as Sinn Féin, isn’t as entitled as anybody else to be at the decision-making table “is just wrong”.
“I don’t take it personally. But that’s wrong in terms of the citizens and the very considerable number of people who vote for us… And I think no political party should just be ruled out in that kind of high-handed fashion.”
The next general election “could be anytime, because politics is quite volatile at the moment”, said McDonald, adding that after it is over she will talk to any party interested in forming a government.

“Yes, of course I will speak to them. I think that’s what grown ups do.”

An election could be a daunting prospect after Sinn Féin’s poor result in the local elections this year.
“It certainly was bruising, and people were hurt by it,” she admits.
“We’ve done our review, and we’ve tried to pinpoint as best we can, the areas where we made mistakes, the areas where we need to change things. And the job now is to get about doing that.
“It was a really bad day out for us. But sometimes that happens in politics, and it’s a test for you. I mean it’s a test for me personally, obviously, as the leader.”
Mixed messaging was a part of it, she admits, as was a lack of messaging, but she added:
“I think our conclusion is that it wasn’t one single thing, actually it would be more straightforward if it was. I think there was a whole set of things that we need to go back and revisit, obviously, our messaging, the manner of our activism.
“I think Sinn Féin is a party that is about social justice, it’s about all of the bread and butter issues. It’s about human rights issues. We’re about Irish unity, we’re about that big picture project, which is so important at this time in particular, and maybe we’ve mixed our metaphors or the clarity of our messaging hasn’t been what it should be been washed, it should be.”
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
One message McDonald has been loud and clear on is her calls for the government to start planning for the future of a united Ireland.
Leo Varadkar said this week that a united Ireland would result in people living in a “different State” with a different Constitution, adding that talks of border polls around the time of Brexit are unhelpful. McDonald believes an all-island forum on the issue must be held now.
“We’ve suggested a forum for that purpose, to talk about Ireland post-Brexit, because Brexit is happening, and it’s for keeps, and it is an absolute game changer. So the responsible thing for government to do is to assess that and to plan ahead.
“The worst thing that could happen, I think, is that we move from a chaotic Brexit, I hope it doesn’t happen, but it’s in prospect, a hard Brexit. And then we bounce from that into a chaotic, disorderly process around constitutional change. I think we need to be just very, very clear-headed and clear-eyed now and recognise that things have changed utterly.
McDonald has previously said that if discussions about a united Ireland are to take place, then so should debate about Ireland joining the Commonwealth.  When asked if Ireland should lead the way in that debate also, she said:
While she said she is not advocating change on any of those issues, she respects that people will have ideas and they will want to bring them to the table.
“But it’s not just about symbols. It’s not just about those pieces like what’s our anthem? What’s our flag? It’s about also what kind of society do we live in? How do we provide education, childcare? What does a national health service for Ireland look like? And how do we find answers? And how do we deliver it?” she said.
“These are big, big questions. And I mean, certain politicians, political leaders, including the government have chosen to bury their heads in the sand and nearly to pretend that you can stop the momentum of change. I don’t believe you can I think for those who, who would say, ‘well, now isn’t the time’, they need to be reminded that on the 31st of October, we are potentially looking at something absolutely defining and it defining breach in terms of this island.”
“And we need to be prepared not just in the short-term, not just ambulance actions, but we need to plan, we need a game plan for Ireland.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/johnson-and-tusk-trade-mr-no-deal-jibes-as-g7-summit-kicks-off-4781009-Aug2019/,"
BRTISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson and EU Council President Donald Tusk have clashed over Brexit on the first day of the G7 summit in France.
As world leaders descend on Biarritz insouthern France, Johnson reiterated his position that the European Union must drop its insistence on the Irish backstop to avoid a “no-deal” Brexit.
“I don’t want a ‘no-deal’ Brexit. I say to our friends in the EU, if they don’t want a ‘no-deal’ Brexit then we have got to get rid of the backstop from the treaty,” Johnson told reporters on the way to the summit in Biarritz.
Tusk earlier today urged Johnson not to go down in history as “Mr No Deal”.
During a press conference in Biarritz, Tusk warned: “One thing I will not cooperate on is a ‘no deal’, and I still hope that Prime Minister Johnson will not like to go down in history as Mr No Deal.”
“We are willing to listen to ideas that are operational, realistic and acceptable to all member states, including Ireland. If and when the UK government is ready to put them on the table,” he added.
Tomorrow I meet PM@BorisJohnson. I hope that he will not like to go down in history as “Mr. No Deal”. The EU is ready to listen to operational, realistic ideas acceptable to all Member States including Ireland, if and when the UK government is ready to put them on the table.— Donald Tusk (@eucopresident)August 24, 2019

Johnson later responded: “If Donald Tusk does not want to go down as ‘Mr No Deal’ Brexit then that point should be borne in mind too,” Johnson said.

At stake is the “backstop”, a provision guaranteeing that border checks will not return between Ireland, an EU member, and Britain’s Northern Ireland.
Johnson has called it “anti-democratic” because it would require London to keep its regulations aligned with those of the EU during a transitional period when the country is no longer a member of the bloc.
The EU argues the backstop is necessary to avoid the re-emergence of a border on the island of Ireland.
Johnson has staked his leadership on a “do or die” withdrawal from the EU by the current deadline of October 31.
Earlier today, Tusk warned that “trade wars will lead to recession, while trade deals will boost the economy” during a speech at the G7 summit of world leaders in Biarritz, France.
Leaders of the G7 club of countries are meeting in southern France today, with the burning Amazon rainforest, falling stock markets and divisions over trade and Brexit providing the backdrop to proceedings.
Speaking at a press conference this morning, Tusk cautioned that US President Donald Trump’s escalating trade skirmishes with China and Europe could force economies around the world into recession.
Tusk also said it was hard to imagine the EU bloc of countries ratifying its trade pact with South America’s Mercosur grouping as long as Brazil fails to curb the fires ravaging the Amazon rainforest.
The European Union “stands by the EU-Mercosur agreement but it is hard to imagine a process of ratification as long as the Brazilian government allows for the destruction” of the Amazon, he said as world leaders flew in for the G7 summit in the French resort of Biarritz.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leave-eu-deletes-xenophobic-tweet-targeting-germanys-angela-merkel-4843710-Oct2019/,"PRO-BREXIT CAMPAIGN group Leave.EU has apologised for tweeting an image of German Chancellor Angela Merkel that one MP later described as “xenophobic bile”.
The image, condemned by cross-party MPs in the UK, was reminiscent of wartime propaganda and read: “We didn’t win two world wars to be pushed around by a Kraut,” alongside a photo of Merkel stood with her arm raised.
“Angela Merkel’s demand that Britain leaves Northern Ireland to rot inside the customs union is reprehensible and shows the true colours of our supposed ‘European allies’,” it said.
The tweet was later deleted.
The uproar came after a Downing Street source said Merkel’s demands for Northern Ireland after Brexit had made a deal “essentially impossible“.
In response to the image, Labour MP David Lammytweeted: “Dear Germany and the EU, please accept our apologies and do not be fooled into thinking Leave EU’s xenophobic bile is representative of the UK.

Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, dissociated himself from “any sort of racist or demeaning language towards Germany” and said he had reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to friendship at a German day of national unity event at the country’s embassy last week.
“The Germans are our friends and our allies, and Germany is a great country,” he told MPs,accordingto The Guardian.
Businessman and co-founder of the Leave.EU campaign group Arron Banks issued an apology for the tweet this morning, despite initially defending the image.
“The Leave.EU team went too far yesterday but the real outrage is the German suggestion that Northern Ireland be separated from the UK,” Banks tweeted.
“As a result we will delete the post and apologise accordingly…on reflection the point could have been made better.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-backstop-4834868-Oct2019/,"BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson is preparing for 10 days of “intensive discussions” as he seeks backing from EU leaders for his Brexit blueprint.
Johnson has said he wants to get an agreement in place by the EU summit on 17 October, paving the way for Britain to leave the bloc with a deal at the end of the month.
With the agenda for such meetings generally set several days in advance, he acknowledged there was “very little time” left.
So far, however, European leaders have reacted coolly to the plan. Some politicians have suggested Johnson deliberately put forward a dealhe knows the EU will reject.
Johnson set out his plan in a letter to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday, to resolve the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop.
Advertisement
In the letter, Johnson said the Withdrawal Agreement has been rejected by the UK parliament three times, and the current proposal would “remove” the backstop from that Brexit deal.
In short, the proposals suggest regulatory checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and custom checks on goods going between Ireland and Northern Ireland:
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke to Johnson over the phone yesterday evening. Varadkar said the proposals do not fully meet “the agreed objectives of the backstop”.
But he also indicated he would study them in further detail, and would consult with his EU colleagues, adding that he wants to see a deal agreed and ratified.
‘Little chance of success’
The proposals are being dismissed by most commentators: former No 10 advisor and EU expert Raoul Ruparel said that the plan has “little to no chance of success”.
“[It means] the prospect of a hard border if the DUP don’t agree in the Northern Ireland Assembly; significant exemption from UCC and VAT, questioning integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union; and a big change to way of life on island of Ireland, burdensome for businesses,” Ruparel tweeted.
Related ReadsWhat are the possible sticking points in Boris Johnson's backstop alternative?
Sinn Féin said the proposed plan would effectively hand a veto to Johnson’s allies, the DUP.
Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the proposals were worse than Theresa May’s deal and warned that Johnson appeared intent on a no-deal Brexit.
Johnson will update his Cabinet, back from the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, in Downing Street today.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-party-fails-to-win-first-seat-in-uk-by-election-4671820-Jun2019/,"
THE NEWLY FORMED Brexit Party failed to win its first seat in Britain’s parliament after it lost out to the opposition Labour Party in a crunch by-election, results today show.
The poll in the city of Peterborough was triggered after the sitting MP, Fiona Onasanya, was rejected by voters after being jailed for lying over a speeding offence.
TheBrexit Party’s candidate Mike Greene, a local entrepreneur, came in second with nearly 29% of the vote, behind Labour’s Lisa Forbes, who won around 31%. The ruling Conservatives came third with 21%, while the Liberal Democrats won 12 percent.

Today’s result is a setback for the Brexit Party – founded by eurosceptic Nigel Farage only a few months ago – which came out on top in the European elections in May with 31.6% of votes cast.
It had been seeking to capitalise on that momentum as well as voter disillusionment with the main Conservative and Labour parties, who have historically shared the Peterborough seat.
Prime Minister Theresa May is stepping down as Conservative party leader today after delaying Brexit twice as she tried and failed to get her EU divorce deal through parliament.
Farage, who has called for Britain to leave the bloc without a deal, said last weekend while campaigning he saw the by-election as “the opportunity for the next chapter in this great story”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/prorogue-scotland-boris-johnson-brexit-court-remain-4793410-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|4 Sep 2019
A SCOTTISH COURT will hear an appeal from British parliamentarians tomorrow, after a judge in Edinburgh today ruled that Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue the UK parliament was not illegal and did not breach the rule of law.
Lord Raymond Doherty ruled this morning that the issue of prorogation is not a matter for the courts and is one of “high policy and political judgement”.
An appeal had been expected quickly and this afternoon a judge decided that an appeal could take place tomorrow in front of three judges.
Whatever happens tomorrow will likely be appealed to the UK Supreme Court.
The case is one of three taken against the UK government after it announced it would be proroguing parliament in the run up to 31 October – the date on which the UK is scheduled to leave the EU.
Tomorrow’s case comes as parliamentlast night succeededin a dramatic bid to secure parliamentary time today to try to pass legislation to frustrate Johnson’s Brexit plans, defeating the prime minister in his very first House of Commons vote.
A group of cross-party parliamentarians submitted the petition asking the Court of Session – Scotland’s highest civil court – to rule that Boris Johnson is acting illegally in attempting to prorogue parliament for five weeks ahead of the UK’s exit from the EU.
The case was brought by SNP MP Joanna Cherry and is backed by 75 parliamentarians, as well as campaigner Jolyon Maugham of the Good Law Project.
Decisions of the Outer House of the Court of Session, where the case was heard today, can be appealed to the Inner House, which typically sits with three judges.

On Twitter earlier today, Cherry wrote that an appeal is being sought“immediately”.
In a statement published after the judgement, Maugham said: “Yesterday’s hearing was always going to be a bit of a pre-season friendly. We’re focused on the Inner House, hopefully later this week, and then the Supreme Court on 17 September.”

The decision to prorogue parliament has been widely opposed by opposition MPs, joined by some Conservatives, and triggered protests on the streets of UK cities over the weekend.
In court yesterday, Lord Doherty heard that one of the documents produced as evidence in the case showed that as early as 15 August. Johnson was strongly considering proroguing parliament.
Johnson only announced his intention to prorogueparliamenton 28 August.
The barrister representing the parliamentarians, lawyer Aidan O’Neill QC, told the court that Johnson and special advisor Dominic Cummings were briefed on a plan to prorogue parliament in mid-August.

Last week, Doherty dismissed a request for an interim injunction ahead of today’s hearing.
“I’m not satisfied that there’s a need for an interim suspension or an interim interdict to be granted at this stage,” he said.
Instead, actual detailed legal arguments were pushed back until yesterday.

Arguments
O’Neill spent the morning berating Johnson and the government’s decision to suspend parliament, accusing the prime minister of undermining MPs and disrespecting the UK constitution.
“This case is about accountability – accountability of executive to parliament and executive to the courts,” O’Neill told the court.
Citing the rule of law, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the UK’s tradition of parliamentary sovereignty, O’Neill accused Johnson of effectively misusing government power.
In the days since Johnson’s announced his intention to prorogue parliament, opposition MPs have made similar charges against the prime minister, who since taking office has committed the government to a tougher stance on Brexit.
The UK government, both publicly and in court yesterday, has rejected the idea that prorogation undermined parliamentary sovereignty, while also claiming that the judiciary should not be able to make a decision on the case.
The government’s lawyer, David Johnston, claimed that prorogation was “political” – a matter for the government, not the courts.
Johnson was not in court yesterday to give any sworn statements – a decision criticised by O’Neill in court.
The decision is the latest twist in Brexit, after Johnson last night told MPs that he would be tabling plans for a general election after a motion passed in the House of Commons offering politicians the chance today to debate a bill to avoid a no-deal Brexit.
“I don’t want an election. The public don’t want an election. But if the House votes for this bill tomorrow, the public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on October 17 to sort this out and take this country forward,” said Johnson after the result was announced.

https://www.thejournal.ie/ross-its-obvious-there-are-going-to-border-checks-after-brexit-4788063-Aug2019/,"MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT Shane Ross has said it is “obvious” there will be custom checks after Brexit but that the government “cannot give ground” over the question of a hard Border with Northern Ireland.
In January, there was widespread surprise after the Independent Alliance TD suggested that Border checks would be inevitable in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
At the time that Tánaiste Simon Coveney had to warn Ross not to discuss the possibility of Border checks in public for fear “that all of a sudden we’ll be the Government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland”.
Then, in July, Coveney indicated that checks on some goods imported from Northern Ireland will be necessary after a no-deal Brexit but insisted that there would no checks “on the Border or close to it”.
Speaking toTheJournal.ie, Ross said: “I put my foot in it already by saying that checks were going to happen. Everyone took my head off and I was right.”
“I said it that day, and I was asked the question, I thought it was the honest reply, which it was. It was obvious.”
The TD admits that he “wasn’t very popular with my Fine Gael colleagues for saying it” but that “they were very good about it. They’d rather it was something I hadn’t said.
“There are obviously talks going on with the European Commission, and the European Commission, again, are going to have to be satisfied.”

“It is absolutely vital there is no hard border, that is so essential. That is something we cannot give ground on.”
Ross said that arecent explosionnear the border in Co Fermanagh shows what could happen in the event of a hard Border.
“That’s what maybe a hard border would provoke, something like that. Checks could be done in different ways. And there are all sorts of ingenious ideas being put forward for those checks.”
On Wednesday, UK prime minister Boris Johnson asked the Queen to suspend parliament from the second week in September until 14 October, less than two weeks before the UK is set to leave the European Union.
Following the move, thousands of people have taken to the streets of London and other cities to protest.
Here at home, Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said a request from Green Party leader Eamon Ryan to recall the Dáil from its summer break will be “seriously considered”.
Speaking to RTÉ’s News at OneDonohoe on Wednesday said his focus is getting Ireland ready for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, reiterating that it is a growing, material risk.
When asked if the developments in the UK will mean changes to the Irish backstop, the minister was clear, replying: “No.”

The group is made up of British people living in Ireland and their supporters. It was formed today in response to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks in September and October.
Brits Not Out says the suspension is an effort to force through a no-deal Brexit.
“We are calling on the many British nationals who have made their lives in Ireland to join our protest against this outrageous and undemocratic act,” spokesperson Grace Williams said.
“We’ve organised this protest to give Brits in Ireland, and their Irish friends and supporters, the opportunity to add their voices to the outpouring of protest that’s been manifest in the UK since yesterday’s prorogation announcement,” she added.
Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament sparked protests across the UK. A legal challenge to the prorogation has already received more than a million signatures from people opposed to the move.
Johnson says there will still be “ample” time to debate Brexit despite the five-week suspension.

https://www.thejournal.ie/medicines-brexit-4835846-Oct2019/,"IF CERTAIN MEDICATIONS are unavailable after Brexit, there are alternatives that can be used, the chief executive of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union said today.
Officials from the Department of Health’s Primary Care Division, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), and the Health Service Executive (HSE) met today to discuss the preparedness for Brexit.
Speaking after the stakeholder meeting, Darragh O’Loughlin said “there is no reason for panic or concern” from members of the public.
“Even if it were the case after Brexit that the landscape looked different and certain medications were no longer available in the Irish market, there will always be clinical and therapeutic alternatives ,so no one will go untreated. Every illness will be treatable, it just might be that a particular brand of medicine that somebody is taking will be replaced by an unfamiliar brand that does exactly the same thing,” he said.
Health Minister Simon Harris said when it comes to monitoring the situation, it won’t end on the 31 October, deal or no deal.
“This will continue to require ongoing vigilance as we make sure that the alternative supply routes are in place and continue to look at emergency contingency arrangements.”
No medicine shortages
He said there are no concerns about medicine shortages because of Brexit, something the HPRA alsoindicated last week.
Some medicines, including those used to treat certain cancers, have a short shelf life and cannot be stockpiled, said the minister.
Harris explained that there is generally a number of weeks of stock built up, and said he is informed that the industry is satisfied that there is sufficient stock to deal with any potential issues in terms of delays that could happen in ports and other places.

“We should be aware Brexit is a permanent state of change and therefore will require constant and ongoing vigilance.
When asked if people can expect to pay more for their medicines post-Brexit, the health minister said “a lot of that depends on where Brexit ends up” and what the future trading relationship looks like with Britain.
He added that the State is not paying more for medicines because of Brexit.
He reiterated that there is no requirement to stockpile, adding that to do so would have unintended consequences to the normal supply chain.
“We’re still considering whether we want to put further contingency measures in place, by way of air, and keeping that under close review, but we’re not aware of any delay in relation to that.
“The 31st of October is just a date in a calendar, it’ll be one day, and if Brexit happens there will be many more days after that and we will need to continue to be vigilant.
“The difficulty of a delay at a port or the like, we have enough of a supply, that we’ll have enough to keep going until they’re through that delay.”
The minister added that his department, the HSE and HPRA would much rather be talking about other health issues.
“We’re spending so much of our time preparing for Brexit,” he said.
Harris added that the cost of Brexit to the State has been “massive”.
“The opportunity cost of Brexit to Government and our citizens, in terms of a programme of work we’d rather be doing, is very clear, but having said that, Brexit is and must be national priority one, two and three.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/marylou-mcdonald-plaid-cymru-4838882-Oct2019/,"SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has called for a “pan-Celtic political culture” between Wales and Ireland to tackle the challenges posed by Brexit and the British government.
McDonald was speaking at a conference of the Welsh political party Plaid Cymru this afternoon.
Wales and England both voted to leave the EU during the Brexit referendum in 2016, while Scotland and Northern Ireland voted by a larger majority to remain.
However, speaking today, the Sinn Féin leader said Brexit and the proposals from the Conservative party in the Westminister were “not the answer” to solving issues within Europe and suggested Wales, along with Ireland, should foster a political culture to fight the “Tory Brexit”.
“The futures of Ireland and Wales must be shaped by the hopes and aspirations of our peoples. Not by Boris Johnson and his band of Eton elitists in London,” she said.
“Toryism is a political culture that has always been a clear and present threat to our well-being.

“We need a counter political culture; a pan-Celtic, anti-Tory political culture that respects each other’s sovereignty and right to nationhood.
“If Boris Johnson cannot put forward proposals that maintain the guarantees in the Backstop, then the ultimate solution of Irish Unity should be put on the table.”
Johnson has insisted he is prepared to pull the UK out of the EU on 31 October despite legislation that prevents him from legally doing so.
He also submitted new proposals on an alternative to the backstop this week which were criticised by both Brussels and the Irish government.
Documents submitted to the Court of Sessions in Scotland revealed Johnson will now ask for a Brexit extension if a withdrawal agreement has not been agreed by 19 October.
While negotiations are still ongoing between the UK and EU, McDonald said: “It would be naive to believe that the Tory view of Ireland and Wales has shifted in any significant way since the days of Thatcherism.
“Not once has the Tory government shown any appreciation or concern of the consequences for Ireland of such recklessness. The hardening of the border. Economic chaos. Endangering the Good Friday Agreement and our peace,” she said.

“This is a Budget that has been developed in the shadow of Brexit,” he told the Dáil today. “The government is clear about the challenges posed by Brexit.”
So how will today’s announcements affect you? This piece will be updated as the Budget unfolds.
We’re live bloggingall the detailand reaction as it happens and here are the main points:
A much-flagged €1.2 billion Brexit fund – excluding EU funding – was announced today.
If there is a no-deal Brexit, €650 million will be provided for agriculture, enterprise and tourism.
€110 million will be provided through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which will support fish and beef industries after Brexit.
Specifically, that’s €85 million for beef farmers and €14 million for fisheries. The government also said that €6 million would be provided for livestock and mushroom farmers, with €5 for the food and drinks industry.

Donohoe said that €110 million will be provided to help“vulnerable but viable firms”.
€40 million will be used to support thetourism sectorin the event of a no-deal Brexit.
For anyone trying to buy a house, the Help to Buy scheme has been extended for another two years to 2021.
Donohoe also announced funding of €1.1 billion to build social housing, as well as an additional €80 million for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.

The government also announced funding of €20 million for homeless services – a 13% increase, bringing total funding to €166 million.
If you’re a renter, there wasn’t much to excite you in the Budget. The height of it - €2 million to the Residential Tenancies Board to ensure rent-pressure zone measures are properly enforced.
There wereno changesto income tax – Donohoe told the Dáil he didn’t want to make cuts that may have to be reversed in the future.
He did announce that the Earned Income Credit for self-employed would increase by €150, bringing the total value to €1,500, while also announcing an increase of €100 in the Home Carer Credit – this raises the total credit to €1,600.

People can claim this home carer credit if they’re married and care for one or more people.
Donohoe also said that he was “recognising” concerns about the capital acquisitions tax on the inheritance of a family home.
He announced that the tax-free threshold for inheritance from a parent to a child would increase from €320,000 to €335,000.
For how this will affect your income, see ourBudget 2020 calculator.
The Rainy Day Fund proved a source of controversy ahead of the Budget.
Today, Donohoe confirmed that €500 million will not be transferred to the fund this year, as the government prepares for Brexit.
Donohoe called it an “appropriate response to the more challenging economic environment we may be facing”.
A much-expected increase in the carbon tax was announced today. The only thing that remained unclear was the size of the increase.
Donohoe announced an increase of€6 per tonneon petrol and diesel, which will come into effect at midnight. This brings the size of the carbon tax to €26
“This will not be easy for everyone,” he admitted, promising a package of funding to be targeted at the midlands.
Health expenditure is set to increase by 6.3% to €17.4 billion in 2020.
Donohoe announced an extra €25 million for the National Treatment purchase fund, while the Drug Payment Scheme threshold has been lowered by €10 per month, bringing the level to €114.
Prescription charges have also beendropped by 50 cent.
As part of the Budget, the medical card income threshold for over 70s increased by €50 for single people and by €150 for couples.
Additional funding – €25 million – was announced to address waiting lists on the HSE.
Donohoe pledged €690m in 2020 for social welfare.
There will be a 100% Christmas bonus to be paid to all social welfare recipients in 2019, while there’ll also be a €5 increase in the Living Alone Allowance in 2020.
A€15 increasein the weekly disregard for the One Parent Family payment, as well as for Jobseeker Transition, which is available to support single parents entering jobs when they have young children.
The Budget will also see an increase in Jobseeker’s Allowance for 25-year-olds from€157.80 to €203. For people aged between 18 and 24 who receive housing support, the rate of Jobseeker’s Allowance will also increase to €203.
Donohoe announced that the government will invest in rural transport – the lack of funding has been a long-standing gripe by rural TDs.

So€9 millionis going to provide for new greenways and urban cycling projects, while €3 million has been promised for infrastructure for electric vehicles – this meansmore charging pointsfor drivers.
He also said the funding would create a new scheme for communal charging points at apartment blocks.
The 1% diesel surcharge introduced in 2018 will also now be replaced with a nitrogen oxide emissions-based charge.
This surcharge will apply to all passenger cars registering for the first time in Ireland from 1 January 2020.
The price of a packet of cigarettes has increased. Donohoe said he is increasing the excise duty on a pack of 20 cigarettes by50 cent, with a pro-rata increase on other tobacco products.
This will bring the price of cigarettes in the most popular price category to €13.50.
As expected, the 12.5% rate of corporation taxisn’t changing.
The fuel allowance is increasing – it’s going up by €2 per week.
The Warmer Homes schemes will also receive €13 million.
Like many other measures,free GP carefor children under eight andfree dental carefor children under six were widely anticipated ahead of the Budget.

https://www.thejournal.ie/johnson-varadkar-meeting-dublin-4801264-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|9 Sep 2019
NO BREAKTHROUGHS WERE made in a brief Dublin meeting between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
The two leaders met one-on-one for more than a half hour at Dublin’s Government Buildings this morning, before meeting for another 30 minutes with their respective delegations.
“While they agreed that the discussions are at an early stage, common ground was established in some areas although significant gaps remain,” ajoint statementsaid.
Speaking alongside Varadkar at a joint press appearance ahead of their meeting, Johnson said that there’s “an ideal” amount of time left to find a solution to the Brexit impasse.
He referred to the 30-day time period mentioned by Angela Merkel at a meeting between the pair last month, saying she was “totally right”.
Both the Irish and UK leaders had played down hopes of any breakthrough at their meeting, as they addressed the media – but Varadkar added that he was hopeful today could provide the start of a solution.
“We haven’t received such proposals,” Varadkar said of possible backstop alternatives, maintaining a line repeated by the EU and Ireland since Johnson became Prime Minister. Meanwhile, Johnson said that the UK government had “an abundance” of such proposals, and admitted that his recent suggestion of an all-island agrifood zone was not a catch-all solution.
He said that he “acknowledged” the complexities involved and the “sensitivities evoked by the very concept of a border”, but concluded that “at the core of each problem you find practical issues that can be resolved” with “sufficient energy and a spirit of compromise”.
“I have one message that I want to land with you today, Leo, and that is that I want to find a deal,” Johnsonsaid.

“I want to get a deal. Like you, I’ve looked carefully at no deal and assessed its consequences, both for our country and yours, and yes we could do it.
Johnson thanks Varadkar for the welcome, and references ""our predecessors who put aside differences.. in circumstances more difficult than we are in now"".pic.twitter.com/E3Rljv4JO0— Gráinne Ní Aodha (@GNiAodha)September 9, 2019Gráinne Ní Aodha/ Twitter

Although Johnson admitted “that this problem of Brexit was not, to be perfectly frank, a conundrum that Ireland ever wished for”, he also maintained that “we must get Brexit done” and that the UK must leave the EU on 31 October, “or else I fear that permanent damage will be done to confidence in our democracy in the UK”.
Northern Ireland
Swerving two questions asked of him on when he last visited the border, Johnson said that he doesn’t underestimate the “technical problems and political sensitivities”, and said that he would “never ever institute” checks on the Irish border – adding that he hoped the EU would reciprocate.
Johnson said that along with “getting Brexit done” by November, efforts needed to be put into restoring the Stormont Executive, which fell apart in January 2017.
When asked about direct rule in Northern Ireland if Stormont hasn’t resumed and there’s a no-deal Brexit, Varadkar crucially said that the Irish government would oppose it, as it would “contravene the St Andrew’s Agreement”.
In an attempt at goodwill, Johnson referred to his and Varadkar’s predecessors, “who put aside differences, who found compromises, who took our countries forwards together in circumstances far tougher than now”.
Varadkar said that the Good Friday Agreement was “proof that old foes can come together to deal with the most intractable of problems”.
Johnson is to return to Westminster for a debate and vote on whether to hold a general election, which will be held this afternoon.

https://www.thejournal.ie/prorogue-what-is-prorogation-ceremony-brexit-4801820-Sep2019/,"PROROGATION IS HAPPENING. After weeks of protest, criticism and legal action, Boris Johnson will today close parliament for several weeks.
But what actually happens during a prorogation ceremony?
The British parliament loves a piece of arcane procedure and prorogation is no different. The whole thing starts with a statement read to the House of Lords on behalf of the Queen by the Leader of the House of Lords, Baroness Evans of Bowes Park:
Remember, while we’ve all been talking about Boris Johnson’s prorogation plans, under the British Constitutionit is the Queenwho formally approved the suspension parliament.
Five peers and Privy Councillors  – acting as a Royal Commission – will instruct Black Rod to summon the House of Commons.

When the Commons does arrive, the Royal Commission and representatives of the House of Commons – namely the Speaker, the Clerk and the Serjeant at Arms – will greet each other.
The Reading Clerk will then read out the official command of the Queen from a piece of parchment, while the Clerk of the Crown follows by announcing the name of each law to be passed.
‘La Reyne le veult’
According to the British parliament website, we should be listening out for the following Norman French phrase during the proceedings. It means “the Queen wishes it” and basically signifies royal assent for each bill.

After this, the Leader of the House reads a speech from the Queen – written by the government – reviewing the achievements of the government.
This ceremony officially closes parliament.
The parliament website also states:
With this prorogation being particularly unusual and controversial, it might be worth watching whether MPs are lining up to shake hands with John Bercow, who announced today thathe’d be stepping downas Speaker.
Once parliament is prorogued,  it won’t sit again until the middle of October – very close to the current deadline of the UK leaving the EU.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-non-papers-4832208-Oct2019/,"LEO VARADKAR HAS welcomed Boris Johnson distancing himself from the non-paper commitments which mention the replacement of the controversial Irish backstop with a series of customs posts along the border.
Speaking during Leaders’ Questions, he said had the UK Prime Minister not done so, it would have been seen as a sign of “bad faith” from the UK.
He told the Dáil that Ireland only ever envisages checks in a no-deal scenario, stating:
“I would ask anyone in the British government who thinks this is in any way a good idea to listen to the people of Northern Ireland… no British government should try to impose a solution upon Ireland which is opposed by the people of Ireland, north and south.”
He added that “there will be checks at the ports, at the airports, perhaps at business level, perhaps near the border too and that’s just the reality of the situation but that is in the context of no deal”.
Varadkar said he had not seen the non-papers, which suggest creating a set of customs posts along both sides of the Irish border, adding that he was aware of the papers existence.
The Taoiseach said he did not discuss any details on what was contained in the non-papers during meetings with Johnson in recent weeks.

He said if the alternatives from the UK are similar to what was contained in the non-papers, then “it looks very like a hard border to me”.
Following reports of the leaked papers,Johnson called for Brussels, Dublin and Berlin to work with him on the “good solution” the UK will be formally setting out.
‘Non-starter’
Johnson’s comments come after Irish political leadersrejectedproposals for customs posts along both sides of the Irish border to replace the backstop.
Coveney described the so-called “non-paper” as a “non-starter” and said it was time the European Union had “a serious proposal” from the UK government if a deal was to be achieved before the 31 October deadline.
The Tánaiste added that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland “deserves better”.
Other political party leaders have also firmly rejected the proposals, with Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald accusing Johnson of “playing chicken” with the EU.
The Taoiseach called on Britain to honour the promises made in relation to there being no border checks in Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leave-eu-met-police-investigation-4808065-Sep2019/,"THE MET POLICE has dropped an investigation into whether the pro-Brexit campaign Leave.EU breached electoral law.
On 5 August, the Met Police submitted a file to the Crown Prosecution Service for advice in relation to its Leave.EU investigation.
The force has said today that it is clear some technical breaches of electoral law were committed by Leave.EU in respect of the spending return submitted for their campaign.

However, it noted that there is insufficient evidence to justify any further criminal investigation.
“It was right to investigate the allegation, however following detailed enquiries it became apparent that the nature of potential breaches of the regulations, the criminal standard of proof required in court and the actions taken by Leave.EU to adhere to the regulations mean that it is now appropriate to take no further action,” Commander Alex Murray of the central specialist crime unit said.Leave.EU’s “responsible person” has been told that they will face no further police action.
The full details of the technical breaches are fully detailed in the Electoral Commission report into the spending return dated 28 May 2018.
The Met Police noted this should be read in conjunction with the county court judgement between Leave.EU Group Ltd and the Electoral Commission of 21 March 2019.
Investigations into the spending returns of Vote Leave and BeLeave remain ongoing.

https://www.thejournal.ie/backstop-proposals-what-next-4837969-Oct2019/,"THE UK HAS finally submitted proposals for what could replace the backstop – but we’re far from an EU Withdrawal Agreement or avoiding an extension.
Although the EU had welcomed written proposals – which arrived in the form of a legal text, an explanatory note, and a letter to European Commission President – the welcome has been cautious.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that they “fell short” of the areas the backstop covered – which is technically true. In the House of Commons this week, Boris Johnson said that his proposal meant that regulatory checks (30%) and SPS checks  (30%) wouldn’t be needed when crossing the border – leaving 40% of checks for customs and VAT, etc.
The UK government is arguing customs checks can take place at business premises away from the border, and that most of the “small number of physical checks” will take place away from the border.
This has confused some in the EU – Leo Varadkar among them – as it relies on a certain level of trust that has been lost between the EU and UK after three years of Brexit talks.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee have both signalled a cautious cause for optimism.
“There was a lot of good things in it and we need to build on that,” McEntee said on RTÉ’s Six-One News, referencing the all-island regulatory zone that “we hadn’t had agreement on before”.
“It’s not Mission Impossible,” Coveney said yesterday.
“Let’s not forget that we have a deal that we know works… The UK wants to change that deal, and while I believe we can change that approach, the outcome must be the same.”
On Friday evening, the European Commission said Boris Johnson’s proposals do “not provide a basis for concluding an agreement” – meaning it was up to Johnson to compromise further.
Negotiations continue
Despite Downing Street sources initially painting the Prime Minister’s suggestions as take-it-or-leave-it proposals, embargoed versions of Johnson’s conference speech reportedly contained the words “final offer” – this was rowed back on to instead describe them as a “basis for discussion”.
Negotiations were continuing between Brussels and London in order to get something that might be acceptable to both sides – but already things seem tense after the UK’s chief negotiator David Frost reportedly offered to stay in Brussels over the weekend but the EUsaid nofor fear of the perception that negotiations were ongoing over the proposals. They later released a statement saying Johnson’s proposals didn’t go far enough.

The crux of the problem
The only way of avoiding border checks – other than the EU allowing Northern Ireland to become a back-door for rules and standards – is to keep Northern Ireland (or the whole of the UK) in a customs union.
But Brexiteers, the DUP and Boris Johnson have said that the UK, including Northern Ireland, will leave the Customs Union in order to strike up free trade deals and set their own set of rules (Brexit was about British sovereignty, remember).
So as it stands, barring a massive politically-costly climbdown by one or both sides, a no-deal Brexit is still the most likely outcome. There isn’t a compromise on whether Northern Ireland should be in the Customs Union – they’re either in or out.
Two days in Belgium
Any possible changes to the UK’s proposals would need to be ironed out before the European Council summit on 17-18 October, where all EU leaders will gather.
Johnson also said in parliament this week that he would consider giving MPs a vote on his self-proclaimed “fair and reasonable” proposals if they’re to be put to Europe – though he said he would prefer to put an entire Brexit deal before the House of Commons (it would probably have a better chance of passing as a full, final deal).
If all this is successful, Johnson would be able to bring that back to MPs (again, maybe) and ask them to approve it by 19 October.
Why the 19 October?
That’s the date contained in Labour MP Hilary Benn’s legislation, which was forced through by opposition MPs and Tory rebels trying to ward off a no-deal in the narrow window they had in parliament before the unlawful prorogation at the start of September.
It says that the Prime Minister must request an extension to Article 50, which would push back the date the UK leaves the EU by at least three months, if an agreement is not approved by parliament by the 19 October.
That request, if approved by the EU, could reset the deadline to 31 January – though some say it would need to be longer than this. If an extension is granted for an election in the UK, it would most likely take place in November/December, so an extension until the end of January isn’t enough time to strike a Brexit deal with a new government, and get it passed through parliament.
Do or die
But Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he will not ask the EU for that delay under his “do or die” commitment to leave by the current Halloween deadline. His Twitter account has been sending outdaily pledgesto leave by 31 October.
Meanwhile, his opponents have threatened another battle in the Supreme Court if he fails to act on the Benn legislation –all sorts of scenariosare being thought out.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Another scenario being discussed is the all-important letter to Brussels instead being written by Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill or UK ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow.

This, if accepted by the EU, would allow the Prime Minister to save some face by saying he personally did not request the delay, while preventing the UK dropping out without a deal.
Parliamentary breakthrough
But if Boris Johnson is successful at the summit and brings back a deal, it would next need to be approved by MPs who rejected Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement three times.
Johnson has decimatedthe minority government backed up by the DUP which he inherited from his predecessor, by expelling 21 Tories who rebelled against him (he had lost his majority before this, however).
He and his government have also irked MPs across the chamber on numerous occasions – with Attorney General Geoffrey Cox calling parliament “dead as dead can be”.
But, with the looming prospects of a no-deal, he might just manage to get the Withdrawal Agreement over the line. In the three votes held on the Brexit divorce deal, those in favour of it have increased each time.
The DUP has already signalled its approval for the new proposals (though they’re the only party in Northern Ireland to do so).
Steve Baker, the chairman of the European Research Group of hardline Tory Brexiteers that vehemently opposed Theresa May’s agreement, also suggested he could back a deal.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said none of his MPs could support Johnson’s “reckless deal”, which he said would jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement.
But any support for the deal could be scuppered by any changes to the proposals needed to get the EU on side – ie, another compromise from Johnson on the remaining 40% of checks, which would amount to a backstop.
Another parliament
Even if Mr Johnson is successful in the UK, the European Parliament must also give its consent before any deal can be fully ratified.
His current proposals have been flat-out rejected by the Brexit Steering Group, which branded them as gravely concerning and said they did not come “even remotely” close to a compromise.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-identification-stickers-required-for-northern-irish-drivers-4840528-Oct2019/,"THERE WILL BE no penalty for Northern Irish drivers who do not display GB stickers on their cars while driving in the Republic in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Minister for Transport Shane Ross has confirmed.
Discussions over a GB identification sticker arose last month when it was spotted that a UK government website advised drivers to display this sticker on the rear of their vehicle while driving in the EU after Brexit. This advice remains on thesite.
However, Minister for Transport Shane Ross has said it is not an offence in Ireland to not have a sticker like this on your car.
“There is no offence of not having a sticker of this kind in Irish road traffic legislation,” said Ross in a written statement replying to a query from Sinn Féin transport spokesperson Jonathan O’Brien.
“While I need hardly point out that a person is unlikely to be made liable for vehicle tax simply as a result of not having an international sticker, this is essentially a matter for Revenue.  I understand that there is likewise no offence of not having a sticker in UK law.”

The minister said that national identification stickers are prescribed under international road traffic conventions which applies between Ireland and the UK. The sticker is used to identify a vehicle as visiting rather than based in the jurisdiction for tax purposes.
Ross further confirmed that drivers from Northern Ireland would be able to drive in the Republic if a no-deal Brexit occurs.
TheJournal.iepreviouslyfactcheckedthe issue of Northern Irish drivers requiring GB stickers on their vehicles and found the claim to be unproven.
He said that people crossing the border will be able to drive in the Republic using their Northern Ireland licences on a “visitor basis” with no additional documentation required in this instance.
Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy said that common sense prevailed over the “empty” threat of a GB sticker for Northern Irish drivers.
“For us those of from the border region these are the real outworkings of what represents a hardening of the border.  We will not accept any burden that makes it more difficult to get about our lives on a cross-border basis,” said Carthy in a statement today.

https://www.thejournal.ie/scottish-ruling-prorogation-4804390-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Sep 2019
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has said it would appeal a Scottish appeal court ruling today that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was “unlawful”.
“We are disappointed by today’s decision, and will appeal to the UK Supreme Court,” a British government spokesman said in a statement, calling the suspension “legal and necessary”.
Last week, a judge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh ruled that Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue the UK parliament was not illegal and did not breach the rule of law.
The decision was then appealed and the verdict was delivered this morning.
The appeal court ruled the Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament this month was “unlawful”.
A summary of the judgement said Johnson’s advice to Queen Elizabeth II that parliament be prorogued from this week until 14 October “was unlawful because it had the purpose of stymying parliament”.
The BBC reports that the full judgement will be released on Friday.
It is expected the ruling will be appealed in the UK’s Supreme Court.
In a tweet this morning, First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon called for the House of Commons to be recalled immediately.

Today’s Court of Session judgment is of huge constitutional significance - but the immediate political implications are clear. Court says prorogation was unlawful and null and void - so Parliament must be recalled immediately to allow the essential work of scrutiny to continue.
The case is one of three taken against the UK government after it announced it would be proroguing parliament in the run up to 31 October – the date on which the UK is scheduled to leave the EU.

This case was initially brought by SNP MP Joanna Cherry and was backed by 75 parliamentarians, as well as campaigner Jolyon Maugham of the Good Law Project.
“Huge thanks to all our supporters & our fantastic legal team who have achieved the historic ruling that #prorogation is #unlawful #Cherrycase #Brexit #StopTheCoup,” Cherry tweeted following the ruling.

Today’s ruling comes after the UK parliament was officially suspended in the early hours of Tuesday morning after MPs rejected Boris Johnson’s second attempt to force a general election.
It is unclear as yet if the ruling will lead to the House of Commons being recalled.
Critics of Johnson have hit out at the tactic of prorogation, arguing that it is a means of driving through the government’s “do or die” Brexit plans, leaving MPs with little time to debate the final Brexit outcome before 31 October deadline.
Parliament is due to return on 14 October, with Johnson’s last chance to reach an agreement at the two-day EU summit starting on 17 October.
Johnson says he wants to revise the deal agreed by his predecessor, Theresa May, which MPs rejected, but says this requires keeping open the option of walking away.
Some commentators have said Johnson may be forced to resign if he does not want to make the delay request. Ministers have also hinted at a potential legal challenge against the law.
The Benn bill – which became law on Monday – would force Johnson to delay Brexit until January or later if he cannot get a deal with Brussels.

https://www.thejournal.ie/budget-2020-what-can-we-expect-4837531-Oct2019/,"WE ARE JUST three days out from this year’s Budget, and one thing we can bet on is it won’t be a windfall budget by any means.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe has been downplaying any expectations for giveaways, telling all around him that he will be “safe” and “cautious” as his Budget 2020 is based upon a no-deal Brexit.
Unlike other years, Donohoe had to consider two scenarios when drafting this year’s Budget.
One, in which there is a real possibility of ano-deal Brexit, and the other, in which it is all relatively smooth sailing after the Brexit deadline of 31 October.
Due to the deadlock over the Irish backstop, the minister has decided to err on the side of caution, and opted for Budget option A, in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit.
Speaking at the Fine Gael presidential dinner in Dublin last night, the Taoiseach said the most “prudent” thing to do is plan for a no-deal Brexit.
He said Tuesday’s Budget has to be “different” because of Brexit.
“So, we will not be able to afford tax and welfare packages on the scale of our last three Budgets.  There will, however, be a modest and targetted welfare and a minimal but targetted tax one.
“However, I don’t want anyone to think for a second that this will be an austerity budget.  Or that there will be cutbacks.  We don’t need to take that journey again,” he said.
So what can you expect?
The Budget talks between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil were described as “slow” by TD Michael McGrath, who said quicker progress had been made in negotiations in previous years.
While Donohoe had plans to have talks done and dusted by Friday, it is understood they continued this weekend.
Meanwhile, demands from the Independent Alliance members tend to be on an individual basis, so with less money in the pot this year, everyone is competing for their own brief.
Earlier in the year, the Summer Economic Statement set out a fiscal space of some €700 million. So, as far back as June it was well flagged that Tuesday’s would not be a giveaway budget.
What wasn’t flagged (not even to Fianna Fáil) was that thefigure appears to fall shortof that €700 million (though Donohoe states he is still working off that figure).
McGrath said it came to a surprise to him, and changed Fianna Fáil’s expectations of what it could achieve.
The departments of Health, Education, Social Welfare, and Justice will also require supplementary estimates amounting to €450 million before the end of the year to meet their commitments.
Donohoe also confirmed that he is going to have to dip into the corporation tax take to shore up the overruns in the health budget.
So, with the mood most certainly dampened before Tuesday, and with politicians appearing to be squabbling of the scraps of Budget 2020, what can we expect?
Tax changesare back on the agenda after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that there could be some “modest cuts”.
There will be nothing of the sort promised by the Taoiseach earlier this year when he committedto increasing the point at which people pay the top rate of tax to €50,000for a single person and €100,000 for a double-income couple.
The Taoiseach admitted at the beginning of the summer that he may have spoken too soon, signalling no changes to any tax brackets.

Now it appears, however, that there is “some scope” for tax cuts, though they will be targeted. It is understood that the self-employed may benefit from this measure, with other supports for entrepreneurs also in the plan.
Carbon Taxis another given, with it likely to be increased by €5-€7 on Tuesday. It has been flagged that this could result in prices at the petrol pumps going up on midnight on Tuesday evening, though the minister does also have the option to defer it until January.
Either way, expect queues at the petrol forecourts all day Tuesday.
The government will outline that the tax revenue raised from the new carbon levy will be ring-fenced for climate action policies. There will also be some measures included to ensure that those in fuel poverty are not impacted, but whether they will be deemed acceptable by those opposed to the charge will be another thing.
Additional funding for public transport, particularly in rural Ireland, is set to be announced in a bid to offset any criticisms about the undue cost people living in the countryside will face when the price of running their cars rises.

In terms of electric vehicles, the government has big ambitions to get over a million of the cars on the road by 2030. However, grants are costly to the State, and rather than aggressively prioritising the issue, it is understood the money dedicated to the plan falls short of what it will take to see real, societal change to electric.

Keep an eye out for grants in renewable energy also.
Social Welfareis the item that has caused the most trouble in the Budget talks. Over the last number of years, there have been increases across the board in social welfare payments. This year, Fianna Fáil’s Willie O’Dea, as well as those in the Independent Alliance, have been calling for another increase in the State pension.
During the summer, when Social Protection Minister Regina Doherty usually gives a nod and a wink that an increase is on the way, was more coy. As of Friday afternoon, Fianna Fáil said the government had yet to present their social protection package to them. McGrath said talks on the package would continue over the weekend, but he said nothing was being taken off the table.
Donohoe said the social protection package will be “smaller in scale and will be targeted”.  He said there are a few small options that he is considering.
The Taoiseach has said that modest and targeted spends on social welfare will feature on Tuesday.
TheChristmas Bonuswhich was slashed during the recession has been gradually restored over the years. The minister revealed on Friday that this will be paid out at 100% rate – just as it was at the end of last year.

Housingis another big issue, with the Taoiseach confirming last night that the help-to-buy scheme is set to continue. However, Varadkar said the government is working on “some modifications” to the scheme.
He said this is to ensure “that it actually is helping young couples” and not subsidising those “who can already well afford to buy”.
Fianna Fáil is understood to have insisted that itremain in place, with no changes, something their finance spokesperson reiterated during the week.
There has been speculation that the scheme would be reformed and capped for houses costing up to €250,000. Currently the cap is much higher at €500,000.
Fianna Fáil’s Housing spokesperson, Darragh O’Brien has said he doesn’t see the point of lowering the help-to-buy threshold to €250,000 as it would squeeze out any buyers in Dublin and see the scheme “shut down in all but name”.
However, the Taoiseach’s comments last night would indicate that a lower cap is to be introduced.
Affordable housing is another big item to look out for on 8 October. Both Fianna Fáil and the Independent Alliance are understood to be pushing for some meaningful scheme or programme to be rolled out to help people get their foot on the property ladder.
Childcarehas been mooted for an increase this year, with the government making it no secret that gradual increases is how they see the path forward in terms of providing supports for parents. The National Childcare Scheme, which was announced in last year’s Budget, is only taking applications from this month, so watch out for announcements that are made, but have rollout dates earmarked for 2021.
TheHealthbudget has been a thorn in the side of this government, but it is understood there could be an extension of free GP care for those aged under-eight and free dental care for those aged under-six.
Home-help hours, which have been highlighted throughout the summer, is an issue that both Fianna Fáil and members of the Independent Alliance have included on the Budget wish list, so expect to see additional funding to tackle the rising wait times.
Earlier this year, the government announced that it wanted to increase the availability offree contraceptionsuch as condoms in a bid to reduce crisis pregnancies.
The minister has said he also wants the contraceptive pill to be free for women.
It is expected an announcement on the issue may be made in next Tuesday’s Budget. While it is not expected that such a provision would kick in immediately, it is envisaged that a commitment to roll out free contraception in late 2020 could be on the cards.

Brexit and businesswill be the priority in this budget. The government is working on specific supports for certain sectors who will be impacted by a no-deal Brexit.
It is believed the packages are still being signed off on, but it is hoped that loans, grants and support packages will be accessible in the case there is a disorderly Brexit.
Donohoe said on Friday that the planned deposit of €500 million into the country’sRainy Day Fund would not be madethis year because the government expects it may have to borrow next year to deal with the Brexit fallout. The minister said he could not justify borrowing money, only to sidle it off to a savings fund.
Speaking at a Fine Gael fundraiser last night, the Taoiseach said:
“This budget is different. It’s a no deal budget so it has to be more conservative than previous budgets and what that means is no across the board income tax cuts and no across the board welfare increases.
“But there will be room for a package of modest ones targeted on the poorest and those most in need and there will be a tax package, albeit a minimal one, correcting some anomalies and unfairnesses that need to be corrected.”
He said the exact figure of the Brexit packages still has to be settled on, but added that that it will involve a “financial package to save jobs and businesses that are viable in the long term but may be vulnerable as a consequence of Brexit”.
“So as you can imagine, the area’s most affected will be the ones most protected.
“That’s agriculture and the food industry, fisheries, also exporters’ to the UK and the tourism industry as well and we’ll have to as well have a focus on the border region, which could be very much affected too.”
And in other items, school transport, additional school places for those with disabilities, more resources for the National Treatment Fund, and support for Bord na Móna workers are among last-ditch Budget demands being made by government.

https://www.thejournal.ie/poll-do-you-agree-with-the-taoiseachs-comments-on-northern-ireland-4742598-Jul2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said that he thinks that people in Northern Ireland will reconsider their role in the United Kingdom post-Brexit.
Speaking at MacGill’s Summer School in Co Donegal yesterday, Varadkar said: “I do think that more and more people in Northern Ireland, certainly in the event of a no deal [Brexit], will come to question the union.”

There has been talk recently of a border poll being held in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Varadkar, however, cautioned against having a Green Paper or a form on Irish unity.
As tensions rise following the elevation of Boris Johnson to 10 Downing Street, fears have grown that a no-deal Brexit is becoming increasingly likely, leading Varadkar to assert that liberal unionists in Northern Ireland “will start to ask the question where do they feel more at home”.
The DUP, meanwhile, has criticised the Irish government for “unhelpful” language when speaking about Brexit and Northern Ireland.

https://www.thejournal.ie/the-explainer-podcast-brexit-deal-4857194-Oct2019/,"IT’S BEEN SOME week for Brexit.
On Monday, we knew one thing: that the pressure was on for a deal to be struck between the EU and the UK on Brexit.
After all, there was the Benn Act which meant that should no Withdrawal Agreement be agreed on, Boris Johnson would have to approach the EU and ask for an extension (something he really, really did not want to do).
Then there was the EU summit that was due to begin on Thursday, tightening the pressure further. And beyond that, the looming 31 October deadline.
But still, in these Brexit days no one really knows what’s going to happen. Yet when the chatter started to ramp up on Tuesday and Wednesday, it was really looking like all involved wanted things to come to a swift and positive conclusion.
Downing Street wasworking hard; Barnier believed an agreementwas still possible; Donald Tusk washopeful; Leo Varadkar wasconfident.

Then, on Wednesday night, we heard rumblings that an agreement was about to be struck: all that remained was getting the DUP on board for one thing. By Thursday morning, that had changed to the DUP being against the legal text.
And yet, just a few hours later, we got word: the deal had been agreed.
But what’s in this agreement, what does it mean, and what are the next steps? To explain, we gathered our Brexit experts around the table to chat it out.

RTÉ - IRELAND’S NATIONAL PUBLIC SERVICE MEDIA/ YouTube
WRITER BONNIE GREER has described the reaction she’s received from Ireland for her comments on BBC’s Question Time as “very moving”.
US-born Greer, who is from Chicago but has lived in the UK for 30 years, told the audience at the political programme that “Ireland owes the UK nothing” over Brexit.
A clip of her comments subsequently went viral andhas drawn much praise from Ireland.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Ray D’Arcy showlast night, Greer said of the reaction:

Greer said that she chooses not to have any apps on her phone and therefore didn’t know her comments had drawn such a response until the next day when she was in a train station in Liverpool.
“And I’ve gotten letters from people, handwritten letters,” she added.
“It’s very emotional for people to write to you in their hand and they tell me stories about being in the UK as an Irish person, and what they feel about the country, how important the country is to them, it’s very moving and you feel responsible in a way.”

‘Ireland owes this country nothing’@Bonn1eGreersays Britain cannot ‘shaft’ Ireland if they want a post Brexit trade agreement with the US.#bbcqtpic.twitter.com/nL66tXiSas
Greer said that the ‘special relationship’ between the US and Ireland is far more real than that between the US and the UK and that she was surprised that people did not understand this.
The writer said her visit to Dublin is her first and that it’s been very special in the wake of the reaction this week.
“I was at the lovely, lovely Abbey Theatre today, and it was an amazing experience for me as a playwright, that’s one of the holiest of holy to be there. And this guy walked up to me and just put something on my lapel, I didn’t wear it, because I didn’t know what it was and he said ‘you gotta wear this, you gotta wear this’. So it’s been emotional.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/david-cameron-boris-johnson-brexit-4841564-Oct2019/,"FORMER BRITISH PRIME Minister David Cameron has warned Boris Johnson that he will have to make further compromises if he wants the UK to leave the EU with a Brexit deal.
The current British Prime Minister has said that his blueprint to resolve the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop represents a “fair and reasonable compromise”.
However, EU leaders have so far refused to enter into detailed discussions on the plan, saying it does not represent the basis for a new Brexit settlement.
French President Emmanuel Macron has warned that the workings of a deal need to be in place by Friday if there is to be an agreement at the EU summit next week in Brussels.
Downing Street has said these comments were not “helpful” and urged Brussels to match the concessions made by Johnson.
However Cameron, speaking to The Times editor John Witherow at an event to promote his memoirs, said Johnson may have to give more ground to get an agreement.
“The answer I suspect is now compromise on both sides,” he told the audience at the Barbican centre in London last night.
The former premier also said Johnson could not ignore the Benn Act which requires him to ask the EU for a further delay to Brexit if he cannot get a deal by 19 October.
“You can’t disobey the law as Prime Minister,” he said.
Johnson has repeatedly said that while he will abide by the law, Britain will leave the EU on 31 October come what may – although he has yet to explain how that can be achieved.
Blaming Varadkar
The Spectator political editor James Forsyth yesterday quoted a source in No 10 as saying there were “all sorts of things” they could do to scupper a delay.
Advertisement
The source was also quoted as blaming Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for refusing to negotiate, and warning that if Johnson’s plan “dies” in the next few days it would not be revived.
“To marginalise the Brexit Party, we will have to fight the election on the basis of ‘No more delays, get Brexit done immediately’,” the source is quoted as saying.
Over the weekend Varadkar said the Irish government’s position on Brexit has beenclear and consistent.
“We have adopted a twin track approach. First, to get a deal. We want a deal and believe it is possible. And we’ll work to get one until the very last moment, but not at any cost,” the Taoiseach said.
Cameron also warned there was no guarantee the Conservatives would win a general election, which Johnson has been pressing for.
“I fought an election in 2015 when I was told I was definitely going to lose, and I won. And I fought a referendum (on leaving the EU) and I was told I was definitely going to win, and I lost,” he said.
Meanwhile, British opposition parties remain divided on how best to prevent a no-deal Brexit.
The latest meeting of party leaders at Westminster ended yesterday without agreement, amid accusations Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was acting as a “barrier” to an agreement.
Labour has insisted that if Johnson is defeated in a vote of confidence, Corbyn should lead an interim government to seek a new Brexit delay – something the Liberal Democrats and rebel Tory MPs who lost the party whip oppose.
Parliament is due to prorogue again at the end of business today, ahead of the Queen’s Speech on Monday setting out the government’s new legislative programme.
Meanwhile the Lib Dems received a further boost with the announcement that former Tory MP Heidi Allen has become the latest defector to join the party, taking their tally of MPs to 19.
The South Cambridgeshire MP has been sitting in the Commons as an independent since quitting the Change UK group in June.

https://www.thejournal.ie/john-major-legal-challenge-prorogue-parliament-brexit-4718480-Jul2019/,"FORMER BRITISH PRIME Minister Sir John Major has pledged to launch a legal challenge if the country’s next leader suspends parliament over Brexit.
Major, who led the UK between 1990 and 1997, said the possibility that parliament could be prorogued to force through a no-deal Brexit was “utterly and totally unacceptable”.
He toldBBC Radio 4′s Today programme:
Proroguing marks the end of a parliamentary session, and would mean the suspension of the British parliament without its dissolution.
If it were to happen, it would mean the end of all parliamentary business during that session, and MPs would not be able to participate in any parliamentary business – including the launching of new bills – until the start of a new session.
It has been suggested that parliament could be prorogued in order to force through Brexit on 31 October, as any legislation which could block the UK’s exit from the EU would be off the table, and MPs would not be able to table motions to stop it.
The idea has been a feature of the Tory leadership campaign, with front-runner Boris Johnson refusing to rule it out.
However, proroguing parliament requires permission from the Queen, something which Major suggested could initiate a constitutional crisis.

“If her first minister asks for that permission, it is almost inconceivable that the Queen will do anything other than grant it; she’s advised by her first minister so she will grant it.”

Major claimed that there would be numerous calls for a judicial review of any decision to prorogue parliament, before saying that he would challenge such a decision if it was made.
“The Queen’s decision cannot be challenged in law, but the Prime Minister’s advice to the Queen can, I believe, be challenged in law” he said.
“And I, for one, would be prepared to go and seek judicial review to prevent parliament from being bypassed.”
He added that he did not know if Boris Johnson would actually prorogue parliament if he became Prime Minster, but said that the former foreign secretary could only be taken at his word.
Yesterday,the government published new documentson its plans for a no-deal Brexit, which outlined the possibility of customs checks at Irish ports and airports.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney said that the Irish government was still in discussions with the EU Commission about how to protect the EU Single Market, so as to ensure the border with Northern Ireland did not become a “backdoor”.
He added that a no-deal Brexit would be a “very, very difficult issue for Ireland to deal with” which would have “profound” economic implications for Ireland on “all levels”.

CANDIDATE FOR THE next British Prime Minister Jeremy Hunt has said that the disagreements over the backstop boil down to “a disagreement on what technology can do” and said a border in Northern Ireland can be avoided “with the technology we have”.
His opponent, and frontrunner in the race Boris Johnson said that the backstop represented the incoherence of the UK’s Brexit strategy, and that the UK’s draft deal with the EU was “a dead letter”.
The Tory party leadership hustings are taking place in Belfast today, with the two remaining candidates to become Tory party leader and British Prime Minister facing questions about their potential leaderships.
Responding to questions first, Foreign Secretary Hunt said that “I recognise we are never going to have a deal with the EU with a backstop – so it has to change or it has to go”.
“The principle that we shouldn’t have border infrastructure is accepted on all sides,” he said, adding that they couldn’t accept a backstop that would “traps us into following EU customs tariffs until the EU gives us permission to leave”.

In response to the same question, Boris Johnson said that the backstop presents the UK Prime Minister with an “unacceptable choice” between “abandoning governing ourselves, or to give up control of the government of Northern Ireland, and that is clearly unacceptable”.
He added: “The Withdrawal Agreement, as it stands, is a dead letter.
He said that the backstop represented both wanting to come out of the EU, and also remaining in alignment with the EU’s Custom Union and Single Market.
When asked what he thought of the politicians of Northern Ireland being paid and not taking their roles in Stormont, Hunt said: “It is totally unacceptable that are not turning up to work and doing their job” and that “this is a big abdication of their responsibility”.
Hunt said that the lesson that was learned from the success of the Good Friday Agreement was that the “personal involvement” of the Prime Minister was needed:

“Restore Stormont and get it over the line,” Johnson said. “I would do whatever I can personally to try to bring people together – it’s the citizens and voters of Northern Ireland who are being failed.”

Abortion and same-sex
When asked about whether Westminster would legalise for more liberal abortion laws and same-sex marriage, Hunt said: “If I was Northern Irish, I would want those changed.”
He added that, “consensus in the province” was needed to move forward.
Johnson said that it was a matter for Northern Ireland, and encouraged those elected to the Stormont Assembly to come to an agreement.
“The forum to solve these difficult political questions” was Stormont.

The DUP
Hunt was also asked what his views on the DUP were – he said that if he were to become Prime Minister, he would be open to doing a deal with them, but added:
Johnson described the DUP as “indispensable” in keeping the Tory party in power.
The Tory party currently has no MPs from Northern Ireland, and has an estimated 500 members in the region.
When asked whether the Conservative Party needs to “organise better” in Northern Ireland, Johnson said that “this looks pretty proper to me”.
For a light-hearted question at the end, both were asked which Game of Thrones character they identify with the most. Hunt said that if he had to, he’d choose Jon Snow, the hero of the hit television programme.
Boris Johnson said that he didn’t know the show well enough to answer, and was subsequently asked to choose a Star Wars character instead – after he made reference to the film franchise.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION CHIEF Jean-Claude Juncker has said that Brussels could drop the so-called “backstop” solution for Northern Ireland if Britain came up with a fail-safe alternative.
“If the objectives are met – all of them – we don’t need the backstop,” Juncker told Sky News.
The disputed proposal attempts to guarantee that no hard border emerges between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in any Brexit scenario.
However, its effort to simultaneously ensure that the EU’s single market remains protected would temporarily keep the UK in the bloc’s customs union.
The fix has been repeatedly rejected by the UK parliament and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to come up with a new plan – and not sign any deal in which the backstop remains.

His government is instead trying to draft “alternative arrangements” that could make sure that no hard border is required for handling trade once Britain leaves the bloc.

Juncker said he had a “rather positive” meeting with Johnson in Luxembourg on Monday and still thought a deal could be done before the 31 October Brexit deadline.
He added that Brussels received the first outlines of Britain’s new plan last night and that he had not had time to study them yet.
“As far as the so-called alternative arrangements are concerns, allowing us and Britain to achieve the main objectives of the backstop. I don’t have an erotic relation to the backstop,” Juncker said.
“But if the results are there, I don’t care about the instruments.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/fianna-fail-think-in-martin-election-4801600-Sep2019/,"FIANNA FAIL LEADER Micheál Martin has ruled out an election this side of the calendar year so Brexit can be prioritised.
Speaking at the start of his party’s annual think-in in Gorey, Wexford, Martin said that he was “putting the national interest first” and indicated that he won’t seek to collapse the government.
Martin said that the country will most likely go to the polls in the early spring next year.
“The national interest comes first. Fianna Fail will not precipitate a general election,” Martin said.
While he conceded that the potential of a no-deal Brexit creeps closer to a reality, he said it is the hope of Fianna Fáil that the domestic turmoil in which Boris Johnson and his stalled Tory government currently finds itself may ultimately lead to a deal being done at the last minute.
Martin added: “One hopeful situation is that Boris Johnson is in a tight corner and he wants to leave at the end of October.”
Fianna Fáil’s think-in ahead of the new Dáil schedule is expected to last until tomorrow afternoon.

While the party has decided not to pull the plug on the current Government, it said there were many aspects of Varadkar’s Government that has left Fianna Fáil with considerable concerns.
Martin said that the housing and homeless crises, along with the overspends in health as well as the national broadband plan are serious causes of concern for the opposition party.
The Fianna Fáil leader also attacked what he called “the dark arts” at play within the health system’s books.
But despite the party’s gripes, they will remain the course and continue to prop up Fine Gael.
Martin also called on the Government to come clean on no-deal planning. Leo Varadkar last week accepted that some checks may have to take place close to the border in the case of the UK leaving the EU without any sort of deal. He said that he “didn’t think the government was telling the truth last year when they said there would definitely be no checks after Brexit”.
Despite propping the current Government up, Martin was not afraid to have a pop at those he and his party continue to support. Commenting on a recent Fine Gael video which attacked Fianna Fáil’s policies, Martin said that he may well take the barb as a compliment.
He added: “The defining characteristic of this Government is spin rather rather than substance of what they should be about, which is giving people the detail around a no-deal Brexit, telling us the truth about what will happen at the border and how the talks at the EU Commission are going.
“It’s silly stuff and I’m not too exercised by it; when people start attacking you sometimes it can be a compliment.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/house-of-commons-vote-4863023-Oct2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS just lost a crucial Commons vote on legislation to implement his revised Brexit deal – leading to the EU to consider the UK’s request for a three-month extension to the Brexit timeline.
Tonight, MPs voted to allow Boris Johnson’s Brexit legislation to proceed after speaker John Bercow yesterday disallowed a second straight yes or no vote on the revised deal agreed last week with the European Union.
That vote had been expected to go the government’s way (the final vote was 329 to 299), but Johnson has just lost a second one on his accelerated timetable to rush the legislation through – which forces another request for an extension to be considered.
In the hour following the vote, European Council President Donald Tusk said that as Johnson had lost his vote and decided to “pause” the process of ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, that he would recommend that the EU27 accept the UK’s request for a third extension until the 31 January 2020.
That request was enshrined in the Benn legislation that MPs voted for in early September, and was the subject of controversy over the weekend after Johnson sent three letters to comply with it, but didn’t sign the letter requesting an extension.

What was actually voted on?
Members had been asked to back the Prime Minister’s three-day timetable to hurry the legislation through the British parliament by the end of the week.

The 110-page piece of legislation translates the 585-page draft EU-UK Brexit deal into British law. Critics had argued that this wouldn’t be enough time for the legislation to be scrutinised properly.
The final tally was308 in favourof the government’s three-day timetable versus322 against. The DUP were among MPs that voted against Johnson’s motion.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that the House “has refused to be bounced” into scrutinising Johnson’s Brexit legislation in just two days “with barely any notice”.
Corbyn told Johnson that a “sensible” timeframe should be put forward that the House would find acceptable.
In the wake of the vote, Johnson welcomed the result of the first vote in support of the legislation to implement his deal.
He said the country now faced further uncertainty and that the government must take “the only responsible course” and accelerate preparations for a no-deal Brexit.
Johnson said that he was “disappointed” that the House had voted for a delay, and said that “the EU must now make up their mind” in relation to the submitted request for an extension to the Brexit timeline.
Until he gets a response from EU leaders, Johnson told the House of Commons that “we will pause this legislation”. Ahead of the vote, Johnson had pledged to pull his Brexit legislation and call for a general election.

“One way or another we will leave with this deal,” Johnson told MPs.
Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg later told MPs that instead of the proposed timetable that the House of Commons just voted down: “Tomorrow there will be a continuation of the debate on the Queen’s Speech”, on Thursday the debate on the Queen’s Speech will conclude, and on Friday the House of Commons will not sit, as per usual.
In a statement, a European Commission spokesperson said that it “takes note of tonight’s result and expects the UK government to inform us about the next steps. The European Council President is consulting leaders on the UK’s request for an extension until 31 January 2020.”
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar alsotweetedhis reaction to the vote: “It’s welcome that the House of Commons voted by a clear majority in favour of legislation needed to enact Withdrawal Agreement.
“We will now await further developments from London and Brussels about next steps including timetable for the legislation and the need for an extension.”
At 9.15pm, Tusktweetedthat he would recommend that an extension be granted.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-economic-report-ireland-uncertainty-4718729-Jul2019/,"IRELAND’S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK “remains clouded by uncertainty”, according to the European Commission’s summer economic forecast.
Thereportpoints to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, and the knock-on effect this will have on exports and taxation, as a reason for the uncertainty.
In the first quarter of 2019, unemployment fell to 5%, a feat last seen in 2007 during the Celtic Tiger, while employment was up 3.7% year-on-year.
Average weekly earnings rose by 3.4%, according to the report, in line with last month’sCSO figureswhich said there was a 3.3% increase in average wages compared to 2018.
GDP is forecast to grow by 4% in 2018 and by 3.4% in 2020, while inflation – the price consumers pay for goods and services – is forecast to rise to 1.1% this year, and to 1.3% in 2020.
However, positive forecasts for Ireland’s economy on the back of the gains made recently have been thrown into doubt as the latest Brexit date of 31 October draws nearer.
“The economic outlook remains clouded by uncertainty, particularly relating to the terms of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and changes in the international taxation environment,” the report said.

“More generally, the difficult-to-predict activities of multinationals could drive headline growth in either direction. In the absence of major negative external shocks, the risk of overheating could increase in the near term.”
Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, who are competing for the role of Conservative leader to become British prime minister, have said they won’t rule out leaving Europe without a deal in October.
Production
Meanwhile, the decline in industrial production towards the end of 2018 was reversed at the beginning of 2019. Construction output increased by 5.9% in the first quarter of 2019, and new dwelling completions accelerated to 23.2%.
“Domestic activity is projected to continue growing at a solid pace with robust private consumption growth underpinned by strong growth in employment and wages.
GDP will slow down, however, “on the back of less favourable prospects in key export markets, increasing capacity constraints and a slowdown in government expenditure”.
As a whole, the EU has experienced marginal economic growth, but this is forecast to fall from a rate of 1.9% in 2018 to 1.2 in 2019.
Last week,NTMA chiefConor O’Kelly told the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee that Ireland has a 100% chance of entering a recession because of the “mountain of debt” it has to repay.

https://www.thejournal.ie/there-is-enormous-hostility-among-some-eu-members-towards-any-further-brexit-extension-4690870-Jun2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR said there is “enormous hostility” towards the UK from EU members over the prospect of any future extensions to Brexit.
The comments come following a meeting between Varadkar and EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier  in Brussels today.
The EU has repeatedly said the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened, and speaking to reporters this afternoon, Varadkar reiterated that message.
“The withdrawal agreement is not going to be reopened but we are willing to consider amendments to the joint-political declaration, and if there is no agreement then there is no transition period for the United Kingdom,” he said.
“There’s no withdrawal agreement without a backstop and there is no implementation period without a withdrawal agreement.
The UK has been granted an extension to get the withdrawal agreement passed through parliament before 31 October or face a no-deal Brexit.
Theresa may tried and failed on three occasions to win enough votes in Westminister before announcing her resignation last month.

Varadkar today said a further extension would not be granted to facilitate further negotiations and that it would take a general election or a second referendum for another extension to be considered.
“While I have endless patience some of my colleagues have lost confidence quite frankly with the UK and there is enormous hostility to any further extension.
“So I think an extension could only really happen if it were to facilitate something like a general election in the UK or perhaps even like a second referendum if they decided to have one.
“What won’t be entertained is an extension for further negotiations or further indicative votes. The time for that has long since passed,” he added.
Conservative race
Meanwhile, Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove are battling it out to replace Theresa May at 10 Downing Street.
All three have said they would leave with a no deal if the Withdrawal Agreement is not reopened.
Rory Stewart, who was eliminated yesterday, was the only candidate to insist he would not leave without a deal on 31 October.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-dup-brexit-vote-house-of-commons-4856487-Oct2019/,"IF IT FEELS like we’ve all been here before, we have. But that doesn’t stop today’s vote in the House of Commons possibly being one of the most important days so far in the Brexit process.
Today, UK prime minister Boris Johnson will present his freshly negotiated deal with the EU to the House of Commons. The agreement introduces important changes to customs and regulations in Northern Ireland, as well as the role of Stormont in deciding the longevity of those customs arrangements – all in the name of scrubbing away the backstop.
The DUP has already confirmed that it will vote against the deal, leaving Johnson with a narrow path to winning a vote in the House of Commons and leaving room for plenty of drama.
So what will actually happen today?
MPs will vote on whether or not to back the deal negotiated by Johnson, as required under the EU Withdrawal Act.
Things will kick off from 9.30am today – the first time since 1982 that parliament has sat on a Saturday.
We’re expecting an opening statement later from Johnson, who will no doubt be stressing his negotiating nous against the EU. After that, parliamentarians will debate the merits or otherwise of the deal – you can count on Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems to largely rubbish it.
Advertisement
The key moment will be the vote. It’s scheduled for 2.30pm but between debates and amendments it could stretch on well into the evening.
Why are MPs voting on a Saturday?
Firstly, the vote is hugely significant. This is Boris Johnson’s opportunity to do what Theresa May never could and pass a Brexit deal through the House of Commons.
The problem is, the prime minister is short on time if he wants to meet this deadline of 31 October. He also faces the reality of the Benn Act, passed by parliamentarians against the wishes of the government.
Under the act, Boris Johnson is forced to ask for an extension from the EU if a withdrawal agreement has not been approved by the House of Commons by 19 October.
What happens if the deal passes?
If Johnson manages to pass the motion seeking this approval today, he will have fulfilled the legal requirements of the Benn legislation.
This would be the start of the legislative path to Boris Johnson’s vision of Brexit, which will need to be rushed into law before 31 October.
He will have to immediately work to put the Withdrawal Agreement Bill into law, which MPs and the House of Lords will also have to first scrutinise and then vote on.
Related ReadsPoll: Will Boris Johnson's Brexit deal pass in the House of Commons?DUP says voting against Brexit deal 'not the end of the game''The backstop has been replaced': Varadkar hails agreement between EU and UK
What happens if the deal doesn’t pass?
If the motion today is unsuccessful and if MPs don’t vote in favour of no-deal, then the Benn Act still stands – meaning Johnson will have to ask the EU for an extension.
Alternatively, if the deal does pass but the Withdrawal Agreement Bill doesn’t in the coming days, then theUK could end upheading towards a no-deal Brexit.
What else could happen?
The entire day remains somewhat unpredictable as the motion put forward by the government could be amended.
One important amendment is the Letwin amendment, put forward by former Tory MP Oliver Letwin, which would withhold approval for Johnson’s deal pending the enactment of legislation implementing the deal.
There have been suggestions that Labour may try to table an amendment to call for a second referendum (or ‘people’s vote’ in the slang of campaigners), so we could expect some surprises.

Figures obtained byTheJournal.iefollowing a freedom of information request show that 5,470 people contacted the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS), which is administered as part of the Road Safety Authority (RSA), in relation to Brexit since 25 February 2019.
Earlier this year, the government began issuing warnings to people in possession of UK driving licences who want to drive in Ireland following a no-deal Brexit.
Anyone living in Ireland who holds a UK or Northern Irish driving licence is being told that they must exchange it for an Irish driving licence before 31 October 2019 – the date the UK is scheduled to leave the EU.
Since taking officer, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has stepped up no-deal preparations, raising fears that a no-deal Brexit – once treated as a remote possibility – is now increasingly likely.

Onits website, the NDLS warns:
The RSA did not comment in time for publication when contacted byTheJournal.ie.
However, earlier this month iturged holdersof a UK licence to exchange it for an Irish driving licence before a no-deal Brexit.
So far in 2019, nearly 30,000 UK licences have been exchanged for an Irish driving licence – this is an increase from 6,000 in 2018.
“The fact is a UK licence holder resident here must exchange their UK licence for an Irish one. It is vital that this is done before the UK leaves the EU because under current EU arrangements a UK licence holder resident here in Ireland has an entitlement to exchange the licence for an Irish driving licence,” CEO of the RSA Moyagh Murdock said earlier this month.
According to the latest government information, visitors from the UK or Northern Ireland will still be able to drive in Ireland following Brexit without an international driving permit.
The NDLS has also advised that anyone who lives in Northern Ireland but works across the border will still be able to drive using a UK driving licence.

https://www.thejournal.ie/bexit-uncertainty-irish-farming-sector-4812130-Sep2019/,"THE IMMINENT RISK of damaging consequences from the UK leaving the European Union is looming large over Ireland’s farming sector, compounding long-running concerns over low incomes.
A fresh analysis by Central Bank economist Dr Thomas Conefrey shows that beef and sheep farms, which make up about 70% of Irish farms, face significant viability challenges and are heavily reliant on direct payments.
Direct Paymentsare part of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), with the money allocated by the EU to Ireland on a yearly basis. In 2019, Ireland’s annual ceiling for direct payments is €1,211,066,000.
In Ireland, the agri-food industry accounts for 8.6% of employment, and 10.3% of exports.
The analysis found that one in every three Irish farms are classified as economically vulnerable and the sector as a whole was found to be at risk from any negative economic development – even one less significant than Brexit.
The research found that the impact of Brexit will not be distributed evenly across the sector, with the west, mid-west and midland regions set to be worst affected due to the greater dependence on low-margin beef farming.

The south-east and south-west of Ireland have the highest proportion of specialist dairy farms – which is the most viable type of farming.
Nearly 25% of farms in the south-west are dairy farms. This figure comes in stark contrast to the situation in the west, where around one in forty farms are dairy farms.
Despite it facing considerable challenges, beef farming accounts for over half of all farms, making it, by far, the most common type of farming pursued in Ireland.

Dr Conefrey’s economic letter notes that the average income on cattle-rearing farms last year was just over €8,300, around one-eighth of the income on dairy farms.

Direct paymentsmade up more than 100% of combined income on all beef farms, indicating that many of these farms made a loss on their farming activities.
Because of this vulnerability, risks such as Brexit could potentially further expose the viability challenges facing many Irish farmers, said the report.

Despite falling by almost a third compared to 2017, dairy farms had the highest family farm income last year. The average farm income came in at €61,446, with tillage farms coming in second highest, at just under €41,000.
The economic letter says that options should be explored that would have the dual benefits of safeguarding the incomes of farmers while also delivering reductions in Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions.
“Low profitability in certain sectors and high reliance on direct payments are weaknesses in the sector that should not be ignored,” Central Bank director Mark Cassidy said.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney will give cabinet a situation update on Brexit today. A key part of the memo relates to ongoing Brexit awareness public outreach and steps to take for small to medium enterprises.
It is understood that the ploughing championship is being treated as a key platform for Brexit information, with several Brexit seminars happening across all state agencies and in the government of Ireland village.

https://www.thejournal.ie/no-deal-budget-most-likely-4804332-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Sep 2019
FINANCE MINISTER PASCHAL Donohoe has ruled out a reduction in personal taxation in the next Budget and said the welfare package will be “different in scale” to previous years.
The minister received approval from Cabinet to base Budget 2020 around the assumption that there will be a no-deal Brexit come 31 October.
The Government is set to deliver a range of budgetary measures on 8 October to the tune of €2.8 billion.
Some €2.1 billion of that has already been committed to projects outlined in the Summer Economic Statement in June, with the remaining €700 million thought to be earmarked for tax cuts and increased spending.
With a no-deal Brexit looking more likely by the day, Donohoe sought permission from Cabinet today to base the Budget around the impact this would have on Ireland.
Speaking to reporters today, he said the government had to make sensible choices for the Budget, ruling out any reductions in personal taxation or sweeping welfare increases.
Donohoe said there are many who would argue, given that the economy is doing well, that there is a case for personal tax reductions before Brexit.
“I am not going to do that, I am going to make a set of very safe choices.”
He said he wanted to maximise the resources available to the government to help citizens who find themselves in difficulty as a result of a no-deal fallout.
The minister said the government has already seen a situation in Ireland where taxation and welfare decisions were made that the country later could not afford.
“And we have seen the difficulty in undoing them.”
A statement from the Department of Finance said the budget aims “to give certainty to businesses and citizens” and “supporting sectors and regions most exposed to Brexit-related disruption”.

Speaking after the meeting, the minister said: “A no deal Brexit will have profound implications for Ireland on all levels. These include macroeconomic, trade and sectoral challenges, both immediately and in the longer term.”
He added: “While there are risks ahead there are also opportunities; our goal is to position our economy to minimise these risks and to maximise the opportunities that lie ahead.”
Sensible
The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council this morning said a no-deal Brexit budget is the most sensible option for Budget 2020 ahead of Donohoe’s meeting with cabinet ministers.
In its pre-budget submission, the budget watchdog warned that the economic outlook  has deteriorated in recent months as the risk of a hard Brexit has increased.
It also warned the Government should not rely on corporation tax outperformances to balance the budget and that it should not expect long-term spending to be offset by such a volatile source of income.
Seamus Coffey, Chair of the council said there is significant uncertainty in relation to Brexit just weeks out from the 31 October divorce deadline.
“I think planning on the basis of a hard Brexit given what we know is the most appropriate course of action,” he said speaking on RTÉ Radio 1′sMorning Ireland programme.
“That’s not to say that it will happen or even that the probability of it happening is above 50% but of the range of possible outcomes that Brexit can bring, it does appear that a hard Brexit is the most likely and planning on the basis of that for the budget over the next couple of weeks is the most appropriate action to take.”
“In overall terms, what happens with Brexit shouldn’t have an impact on the overall package that Government chooses to deliver,” Coffey said.
“The Government has set out a plan for budgetary measures in the 2020 budget totalling €2.8 billion. The advice of the IFAC is that the Government should adhere to, stick to and deliver on that plan.”
“If a no-deal or a hard Brexit is the base line for what they should do in that scenario, then this sort of environment should frame what they do with this €600 million but that is up to the Government to choose what individual or particular measures it wishes to introduce,” he added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/lord-ashcroft-irish-unification-poll-4804372-Sep2019/,"A NEW POLL has shown just over half of people in Northern Ireland would vote for Irish unification if there were a border poll tomorrow.
The poll, published by Lord Ashcroft, shows that 45% of those surveyed said they would vote to stay in the UK, while 46% said they would choose to leave and join the Republic of Ireland.
This breaks down to 51% to 49% for unification when don’t knows and those who say they would not vote are excluded.
“This is in fact a statistical tie, and well within the margin of error,” Lord Ashcroft said in his analysis of the results.
“Such a result might also reflect the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding Brexit, the Irish border and its potential effect on life in the province, which could recede when the outcome is settled,” he said.
“Be that as it may, the result underlines what could be at stake in the quest for a workable Brexit solution on the island of Ireland.”
Lord Ashcroft is a businessman and politician. Since the 2010 election, he has conducted independent public polls relating to British political opinions.
1,542 adults in Northern Ireland were interviewed online between 30 August and 2 September for his latest poll on Irish unification.

One in 20 self-declared Unionists said they would opt for unification and a further 6% said they didn’t know how they would vote.
Women (13%) were more likely than men (3%) to say they were not sure how they would vote.
The over-65 age group was the only one with a clear majority for remaining in the Union (62% to 38% when excluding don’t knows and those who wouldn’t vote).
Border poll tomorrow
A majority of those surveyed (59%) think that if there were a referendum tomorrow, Northern Ireland would chose to remain part of the UK.
However, when asked what the outcome would be in 10 years’ time, the results were reversed. Most believed (54%) that the vote would be in favour of unification, with just three in 10 people believing voters would choose to remain in the UK.
The results show that Unionists are considerably less confident about the chances of winning a vote in 10 years’ time. However, 87% of Unionists believe Northern Ireland would vote to remain in the UK if a border poll were held tomorrow.

Meanwhile, Nationalists are more confident. While just over half (53%) think Northern Ireland would vote for unification tomorrow, 93% believe this would be the case in 10 years’ time.
Does Brexit make Irish unification in the foreseeable future more or less likely?pic.twitter.com/1QbWLe21uV— Lord Ashcroft (@LordAshcroft)September 11, 2019Lord Ashcroft/ Twitter

More than half of voters in Northern Ireland (51%) thinks that Brexit makes Irish unification in the foreseeable future much more likely to happen. Just 9% of people said Brexit makes it a much less likely outcome.
A total of 51% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland said they would like to see the UK remain in the EU.
There have been a number of other polls conducted on the topic of Irish unification in recent months.
A Red C poll in Mayshowed increase in the number of people who believe a united Ireland is more likely because of Brexit.
The survey, commissioned by pro-EU group European Movement (EM) Ireland, found that 50% of those polled said it was more likely – up 6% on the 44% of people polled in March 2018.
In a poll for Claire Byrne Live/Amárach Researchin January, 44% of Irish people said they felt a referendum on a united Ireland should be held.
Political opinions
In July, the Mayor of Belfast, Sinn Féin’s John Finucane, said the Irish government must lead the way in making plans and preparations for Irish unification.
Speaking to the MacGill Summer School on 23 July, Finucane said the debate about Irish unity does not just belong to Sinn Féin, but to everyone on the island.
He called on the Irish government to set up a unit within government to begin preparations for the possibility of Irish unity, highlighting that the Scottish government has done so.
The Belfast mayor also called for an Oireachtas committee on Irish unity to be established. He also called on the Taoiseach to “appoint an Minister of State with the dedicated and specific responsibility of developing strategies to advance Irish unity and coordinating the Government’s all-Ireland policies”.
The previous weekend, Ireland’s Ambassador to the UK said a poll on a united Ireland would “degrade” attempts to resolve the ongoing impasse over Britain’s departure from the EU.
Adrian O’Neill toldBBC Radio 4′s The Week in Westminsterprogramme that the current priority for the Irish government was to restore the Northern Ireland Executive at Stormont.
Last year, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said a no-deal Brexit would bring the timeline for aborder poll on a united Irelandforward.

https://www.thejournal.ie/hard-border-psni-northern-ireland-simon-byrne-4777312-Aug2019/,"NORTHERN IRELAND’S POLICE Chief has warned that a hard Brexit could help fuel the rise of violent dissidents in the region.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4′s Today programme, Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Simon Byrne said that while police had “no intelligence” that Brexit was behind a rise in dissident republican activity, he was concerned that the combined uncertainty of Brexit and the wider political vacuum could become a “breeding ground for dissident hate”.
“The fear is if there is a hard Brexit the way this could play out in different communities right across Northern Ireland could become a trigger and a fueling point for more people to join either side of the debate,” Byrne said.
Extremists, he said, might exploit such uncertainty.
An explosion, which took place in Co Fermanaghon Monday, is being treated as a deliberate attempt to injure police officers. While no one was hurt, Byrne described it as a “sinister” development.
Today, Byrne condemned the dissidents who he said were “still pursuing an agenda that we were hoping and thought maybe 20 years ago we’d put behind us in terms of getting on and working together”.

Gardaí and the PSNI have established a list of people they believe could have carried out Monday’s bomb attack in Fermanagh.

This has been the fifth dissident attack so far this year. There was just one attack during the same period last year.
Former Chief Constable of the PSNI Hugh Orde warnedearlier this yearabout the risks of a hard border.
Orde said recreating a hard border would have “huge consequences in terms of security” and police and customs officers “would become a target”.
Byrne also warned that effectively policing the border in the event of a hard or no-deal Brexit would prove impossible for the PSNI.
“The reality of using technology, or some form of hard checkpoint, in the border area, is simply just not practical. There are over 300 crossings that we’d have to police on a daily basis to make that effective,” he said.
“We simply don’t have enough people.”
Byrne, who praised his force’s recent co-operation with Garda Commissioner Drew Harris, said communities on both sides of the border want to “see normality continue so they can go about their daily life and business in a way that’s pretty similar to what they’re doing now”.
Due to the high number of incidents this year, police forces from both sides of the border have recently increased their level of communication.
However, Byrne warned that the next few months will prove crucial for the future of policing in Northern Ireland.
“If we get this wrong, we could drift back to almost to a paramilitary-style of policing that nobody wants to see,” he added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/foster-dup-irish-sea-checks-brexit-4807140-Sep2019/,"DUP LEADER ARLENE Foster has refuted reports inthe London Timesthat the party is prepared to shift its red lines to abide by some European rules after Brexit.
The newspaper reports that it understands the party has agreed it would accept Northern Ireland abiding by some European Union rules post-Brexit in a deal to replace the Irish backstop.
It reports that the DUP also said privately that it would ditch its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea.
However, Foster tweeted that the “UK must leave as one nation” and that “anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories”.
“We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that divides the internal market of the UK,” Foster said.
“We will not support any arrangements that create a barrier to East West trade.”
Arlene Foster / TwitterArlene Foster / Twitter/ Twitter
When questioned about the story onBBC NI’s The View, South Belfast MLA Christopher Stalford said he didn’t “recognise that as our party position”.
“I was at an event this evening [Thursday] before I came here, where three members of parliament were speaking and that is not the position of the party,” he said.
In recent weeks, a backstop, solely for Northern Ireland,has been mootedas one option that could break the impasse between the UK and the EU over the issue of the border.
The idea was raised in negotiations between the UK and the EU as a way to avoid a hard border. However, in February 2018 Theresa May ruled out the idea.

However, Fosteron Tuesday saidthat Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ruled out the idea of a Northern Ireland-only backstop.
“History teaches us that any deal relating to Northern Ireland which cannot command cross community support is doomed to failure. That is why the Northern Ireland backstop is flawed,” Foster said in a statement after a meeting with Johnson.
On Wednesday, Johnson said: “I’ve seen a bit of chatter about this, stuff in the media about this – we will not accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop. That simply does not work for the UK.”
‘Terrible example’
Meanwhile, the Commons Speaker John Bercow has promised “creativity” in UK Parliament if Johnson does not abide by the law designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit.
In a speech, Bercow said he believes the only possible Brexit is one the House of Commons has “explicitly endorsed”.
A new law has passed that would force the government toseek a three-month extensionon the Brexit deadline if there is no-deal with the EU by 19 October.
Last week, Johnson said he would “rather be dead in a ditch” than seek another Brexit extension”.
Speaking yesterday, however, Bercow said not obeying the law would be a “terrible example to set for the rest of society”, according tothe BBC.
Bercow went on to say it is “astonishing” that “anyone has even entertained the notion”.
He said that if the government comes close to disobeying the new law, Parliament “would want to cut off such a possibility and do so forcefully”.
“If that demands additional procedural creativity in order to come to pass, it is a racing certainty that this will happen, and that neither the limitations of the existing rule book nor the ticking of the clock will stop it doing so,” he added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mercosur-deal-michael-creed-4702946-Jun2019/,"MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE Michael Creed has said he is “very concerned” about the potential impact on Irish beef farmers ofa new trade dealbetween the European Union and South American countries.
The agreement came after two decades of often tough negotiations between the EU and the countries of the Mercosur trade bloc – Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The deal had repeatedly stalled because of concerns European farmers had about the effect it would have on domestic beef markets.
The Irish Farmers’ Association yesterday said the agreement had “sold out” Irish and European farmers as it warned that cheaper beef with low tariffs would flood the EU from South America.

Speaking after the announcement, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said that while Ireland was generally supportive of international trade deals, he was “very concerned at the potential impact of elements of this particular deal on the beef sector”.
“I am very disappointed that this agreement includes a significant tariff rate quota for South American beef, at a time when the beef sector in Europe is facing significant uncertainty because of Brexit,” he said.
“There may be some opportunity for other agri food sectors such as dairy and for the drinks industry, but we will need to examine the text carefully to assess the full impact.”
The trade pact is the largest ever concluded by the EU and it is estimated it will save European companies more than €4 billion worth of trade duties every year, as well as create a market of about 780 million people.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-parliament-promised-to-deliver-brexit-4788875-Aug2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has responded to criticism of his decision to suspend the British parliament by saying that parliament has tried to deliver Brexit for three years and hasn’t succeeded.
Speaking in an interview withSky News, in his first interview since the queen granted his request to prorogue parliament, Johnson said that political opponents were harming his chances of a getting good deal with the EU.
“Parliament triggered Article 50, and time and time again, they promised to deliver on the mandate of the people and get Brexit done, and I hope that they will.
“We’re coming up to the last period in which we leave and parliament will have a lot of time – they’ve spent three years debating Brexit without getting it over the line – they will have a lot of time for further consideration.”

He said what he wants to do now is “get on and try to get an agreement”.
When asked what his message was to protesters, Johnson said:
“I think the worst thing for democracy now would be to cancel the referendum, which is what some people are calling for now. Everybody can see what the risk is now – if we frustrate that mandate, if we stop the UK from leaving on October 31, it will do lasting damage to people’s trust in politics. It will do lasting and catastrophic damage to political parties.
On Wednesday, Johnson asked the queen to allow the UK parliament to be suspended – known as proroguing parliament – in order to set a new legislative agenda.
But House Speaker John Bercowsaidthat it was “blindingly obvious” that it was being done to stifle parliamentary debate on Brexit – Johnson has said this is “completely untrue”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-ireland-4680726-Jun2019/,"THE TORY LEADERSHIP contest may look like it’s done and dusted but there is genuinely a ways to go yet.
If a week is a long time in politics, then two is an eternity in Conservative Party politics.
So whether Boris Johnson gets there or not, it won’t be until mid-July that we know for sure.
For the Irish government though, they can be sure that any new leader is likely to present even more headaches for the teetering Brexit process.
Earlier this week,TheJournal.ielooked at what thevarious leadership hopefuls have said about the contentious backstop.
Unsurprisingly given that the leadership race has seen a hardening of the Conservative position on Brexit, pretty much all of the main candidates want to see the backstop gone.
Their methods for achieving this boil down to pushing for even more seemingly impossible renegotiation or Sajid Javid’s suggestion that the British governmentbasically pays Ireland to resolvethe situation.
Unsurprisingly to most Brexit followers in Ireland and probably many in the UK too, such an approach is unlikely to get much traction if it is indeed broached in Europe.
It didn’t work when parliament forced Theresa May to do it and a new leader with the same message is unlikely to see a different result.
As if to illustrate that fact to Conservative members in the upcoming vote, Sky News foreign correspondent Mark Stone put the contenders’ ideas to three EU voices – one MEP and two experts in Brussels institutions.

In a report that got some Brexiteer blood boiling, some of their responses included words like “delusional” and a description of the candidates’ plans as being like “promising unicorns”.
Asked about Johnson’s threat to withhold the €44 billion divorce bill until an alternative is reached,Belgian MEP Philippe Lambertssaid it would shred the UK’s standing “close to zero”.
For the Irish government, trust in their British counterparts has already been severely dented by Brexit, and not just by bythe various ridiculous statements made byBritish politicians about Ireland.
A much-discussed article published on Politico last year outlined hownegotiations involving the two governments had “poisoned UK-Ireland relations”.
Mort pertintely given the way the Conservative race is going, there were even reports that Irish officialswere told “not to listen” to Boris Johnsonwhen he came here as Foreign Secretary in late 2017.
TheDepartment of Foreign Affairs strongly rejected the claim, saying it was inaccurate, but Johnson’s actual performance didn’t exactly suggest a harmonious relationship either.
In the days before the backstop became the main point of contention, Johnson and Minister Simon Coveney weresinging from wildly different hymn sheetsabout the length of a Brexit transition period.
At one point Johnson even said he “wasn’t aware” of Coveney’s position on a five-year transition, despite it being the widely stated and reported position of the Irish government at the time.
These kind of public moments of discord may seem like a drop in the ocean when it comes to Brexit diplomacy but Johnson becoming Prime Minister would likely make such public tensions more commonplace.
It’s not just utterances of either genuine or affected buffoonery that will be of concern though. The far more worrying issue is what a Johnson premiership means for Brexit.
Brexit itself places the biggest strain on UK-Ireland relations, regardless of who is in Downing Street, but the spectre of a no-deal scenario becomes even more real if Johnson takes over.
Johnson has refused to rule out such an outcome and inists the UK is leaving the EU in 31 October. This date more than any in the Conservative leadership race is what the Irish government will be focusing on.

https://www.thejournal.ie/emma-desouza-court-case-4801788-Sep2019/,"A WOMAN FROM Northern Ireland who is caught up in a legal battle with the UK government over whether she is a British or Irish citizen has said that she fears the consequences if the Home Office wins the court case.
Emma DeSouza is arguing that her US husband Jake should be permitted residency in Northern Ireland under an EEA residence card, as she is an Irish citizen. The Home Office has refused Jake’s application, arguing that his spouse is a British citizen.
Under the Good Friday Agreement, citizens have the right to identify as British or Irish or both. But despite the UK government being a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Home Office has argued that it has no provision in its own domestic law for such a mechanism, and so all citizens in Northern Ireland are automatically British.
As she was classed as a British citizen, but is an Irish passport holder, the UK government defined her as having dual citizenship, and so her husband cannot apply for an EEA card and she cannot go through the UK immigration system as an EU national. On this basis, her husband’s application for a residence card was refused.
DeSouza says  that the Home Office will argue that the Good Friday Agreement means a person can “identify” as Irish, but is still legally a British citizen.
She said that if the Home Office wins this legal case, it could subsequently revoke any EEA residencies granted to relatives of Northern Irish citizens who had said they were Irish.
“The great thing [about this court hearing] is that the Home Office has to go public with their arguments,” she toldTheJournal.ieahead of today’s case.

Previous tribunals
Three judges have already ruled in the DeSouzas’ favour; this is the third appeal from the UK government to have the couple’s case overturned. The appeal was lodged in 2017, but has been delayed several times over the past two years.
In its original refusal letter to Jake DeSouza, the Home Office said that “the Good Friday Agreement recognised the right of the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and to be accepted as Irish or British or both. British nationality law defines which persons with a connection to Northern Ireland are British citizens, and Irish legislation specifies which people are Irish nationals.”
The judge of a first-tier tribunal ruled in October 2017 that this was incorrect, stating that the Good Friday Agreement changed immigration law: “He or she is permitted to choose their nationality as a birthright. Nationality cannot therefore be imposed upon them at birth.”
The hearing is due before a three-judge panel in the upper tribunal in the Belfast’s immigration courts at 11am today (it was originally meant to start at 10am, but was pushed back).
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has previously said that the “UK has got it wrong in the DeSouza case” and that “the Good Friday Agreement is explicit on this matter – the people of Northern Ireland are entitled to be British or Irish or both.”
The Department of Foreign Affairs will have an observer in the courtroom to watch today’s proceedings.
“Their objective is to make me leave that courtroom as a British citizen,” Emma DeSouza said, “which would mean my husband would have to leave the country – if we lose, there’s every chance that they will push to have him leave.”
DeSouza said that the UK government’s legal argument is effectively “rewriting” the Good Friday Agreement, and makes the people in Northern Ireland “harden” their identities rather than the opposite.
DeSouza says that in the context of Brexit, the UK government has given constant assurances that it’s “committed to the Good Friday Agreement”, but at the same time, it is arguing with her in court that it’s not relevant to British domestic law.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-chaos-information-campagign-4792658-Sep2019/,"A NEW ADVERTISING campaign urging the British public to “get ready” for Brexit has been launched in the UK just eight weeks before the nation is expected to leave the EU.
A new website,gov.uk/brexit, was launched on Sunday and around €110 million will be spent on advertising the new service to the British public.
Michael Gove, the cabinet minister in charge of no-deal planning, said that the ads were being put in place to encourage those in the UK to prepare for October 31 – the current deadline for Brexit.

Gove said: “Ensuring an orderly Brexit is not only a matter of national importance, but a shared responsibility” as he launched the adverts.
Benedict Pringle, who is the author of thepoliticaladvertising.co.ukblog, responded to claims made in the British press that the campaign has a £100m budget would. Pringle said that this amount of money would be approximately half of what the National Lottery spends on advertising each year.
He told theBBC: “So if you think about how often you see a lottery advert and double it, that’s how much we could be seeing the campaign over the next two months.
“At football grounds, in advert breaks for Coronation Street and The Great British Bake Off, this is where you’ll get the biggest reach with the public.”
The Get Ready campaign has also ordered a significant number of branded mugs and t-shirts in a bid to boost its reach, according to the Times. That same paper reported that the campaign toyed with the idea to use the same“take back control” sloganwhich was used in the initial referendum but this was deemed to divisory.

The applicationfor a ‘state development consultation’ was lodged by the OPW’s Brexit Unit last Thursday 17 October, the day a Brexit deal was confirmed between the EU and the UK.
The consultation is to discuss a “shared services facility” which would include: new warehouse facilities and other structures for cargo unloading areas; inspection bays; live animal storage facilities, and other spaces and works.

The application entry on the An Bord Pleanála website says that the case is due to be decided by 28 February 2020. As things stand currently, if a Brexit extension is granted by the EU, the next Brexit deadline would be 31 January 2020.
Among the checks that would be needed are inspections on live animals to ensure they meet the EU’sSPS checkrequirements. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already acknowledged the need to preserve the all-island of Ireland sanitary and phytosanitary checks system post-Brexit.
Dublin Port has spent over€30 millionto date on inspection posts, additional staff and training in preparation for a hard Brexit (where the UK would leave the Customs Union and Single Market).
The Irish government’s no-deal Brexit plansinclude an extra 270 truck parking spaces, 33 inspections bays and a live animal controls area at the port.
A public office with eight counters and accomodation for staff, office accomodation for an extra 144 staff in the Dublin Port area and anew traffic management system is also part of no-deal plans for Dublin Port.

In response toquestions put to himby Fianna Fáil TD Aindrias Moynihan, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed said on 24 September that the decision to put facilities at a port or airport “to carry out import controls on certain regulated products and live animals is based on trade flow analysis”.
“This facility would need to comply with the relevant EU regulations, and be approved for use by the Commission,” Creed said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/johnson-mps-brexit-4858285-Oct2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS urged MPs to back his Brexit deal telling them that the time had come to heal the rift in British politics over the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
As Parliament sat for the first time on a Saturday in 37 years, the Prime Minister said the agreement he has struck with Brussels would allow the UK to leave “whole and entire” on October 31.
However he faces another hurdle with opposition MPsthreatening to vote for an amendmentwithholding approval until legislation to implement the deal is in place.
Oliver Letwin, the former Cabinet minister who had the Tory whip withdrawn after rebelling over Brexit, said it was an “insurance policy” to prevent Britain “crashing out” without a deal on 31 October.
Government sources reportedly warned that if it passed would render the proceedings meaningless and they would simply send Tory MPs home.
After Commons Speaker John Bercow confirmed that he had selected Letwin’s amendment for debate, Johnson appealed to MPs to reject it.

“This is a momentous occasion for our country and our Parliament,” he said.
Johnson called for MPs to reconcile their differences over Brexit.
He told MPs: “The House will need no reminding that this is the second deal and the fourth vote, three-and-a-half years after the nation voted for Brexit.
“And during those years friendships have been strained, families divided and the attention of this House consumed by a single issue that has at times felt incapable of resolution.
The vote appears to be on a knife edge, with Johnson’s one-time allies in the DUP threatening to vote against it.

However, former chancellor Philip Hammond said that he would be among the MPs backing the Letwin amendment.

“We have to remove any risk of leaving on October 31 with no deal.”
Jeremy Corbyn said Labour could not back a deal that was even worse than Theresa May’s deal which was rejected three times by MPs.
“It is not a good deal for our country and future generations who will feel the impact. It should be voted down,” he said.
“I totally understand the frustration and the fatigue across the country and in this House.
“But we simply cannot vote for a deal that is even worse than the one this House rejected three times.”

Despite Johnson not taking part, Luxembourg’s PM, Xavier Bettel, took questions from the press. A lectern from where Johnson was supposed to take questions was left in place.
The EU said this afternoon that Britain has still not proposed any workable alternatives to the Brexit backstop, following talks between bloc chief Jean-Claude Juncker and Boris Johnson.
The first face-to-face encounter between Johnson and European Commission president Juncker failed to yield any major breakthrough, although Downing Street insisted it had been a “constructive meeting”.
Johnson says Britain will not agree to a divorce deal that includes the backstop, a provision which temporarily keeps the UK in the EU customs union to keep the Irish border open, and will not delay Brexit beyond 31 October, even if it means leaving with no deal.
Bettel, who had a meeting with Johnson following the British leader’s working lunch with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker , was scathing about Johnson’s efforts to rewrite a withdrawal agreement the UK had struck with the EU under his predecessor Theresa May.
He echoed the EU’s message that the UK had offered up no viable alternative to the safeguards in that agreement to protect peace in Northern Ireland while respecting London’s intent to break free of EU institutions.
“For me I have just one withdrawal agreement on the table and it’s the one from last year,” Bettel said.
“There are no changes, there are no concrete proposals for the moment on the table and I won’t give an agreement to ideas,” he said, urging Britain to come up with “written proposals”.
Johnson’s absence from what was planned to be a joint media conference was highlighted on social media, where pictures of the empty British podium were relayed.

Juncker’s office said he used the lunch meeting in Luxembourg to reiterate the EU view that it is Britain’s responsibility to come up with a workable alternative to he backstop, which was agreed by Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May but rejected by MPs.

“President Juncker recalled that it is the UK’s responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement,” a statement from Juncker’s office said.

A Downing Street spokesperson said Johnson reconfirmed his commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and his “determination to reach a deal with the backstop”.
With just six weeks to go before Brexit day, the spokesperson also confirmed that discussions will soon begin to take place daily between the EU and UK, rather than twice a week at present.
“The leaders agreed that the discussions needed to intensify and that meetings would soon take place on a daily basis,” they said.
Alongside the main meeting, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also held talks with British Brexit Minister Stephen Barclay.
According to Downing Street, it has also been agreed that talks should take place “at a political level” between Barnier and Barclay.
A small but noisy group of anti-Brexit protesters greeted Johnson as he arrived and left the talks, singing the Ode to Joy EU anthem, waving flags and chanting slogans.
Speaking this afternoon following a meeting with Northern Ireland Secretary for State Julian Smith, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald called on the British government to accept the Northern Ireland backstop.
“[The position that] Boris Johnson has moved towards falls far short of the protections that are contained in the backstop,” she said.
“We have set out again today for the Secretary of State the fact that the backstop is the bottom line.
“It’s the least worst option; it’s not perfect. But at a minimum, it covers the baseline protections [of the Good Friday Agreement.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/faulty-products-seized-ireland-ccpc-4778337-Aug2019/,"ALMOST 350,000 POTENTIALLY unsafe products were seized by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in Ireland last year.
Forty-two consignments containing 346,739 potentially unsafe products were seized by the CCPC and Revenue’s Customs Service in 2018.
The products included toys, sunglasses, kitchen appliances, electrical adaptors, chargers and hoverboards.
After examining the items, the CCPC found that 33,688 of them did not meet the relevant European Union and Irish safety regulations and standards, meaning they were not safe for use by consumers.
The risks ranged from potential eye damage from sunglasses which did not provide UVA/UVB protection to fire hazards arising from unsafe phone chargers.
The products in question were either re-exported or destroyed, according to the CCPC.
Commenting on the products seized in 2018, Isolde Goggin, CCPC chair, said thousands of potentially unsafe products are seized and tested every year “to ensure that goods placed on the Irish market do not pose a safety risk to consumers”.
Goggin added that manufacturers, importers and distributors have a responsibility to ensure the products they sell are comply with all of the relevant safety regulations and standards.

“Failure to do so may not only result in financial loss to the trader but more importantly their products may cause physical harm to their customers,” she said.
Brexit
Addressing how Brexit could affect Irish businesses, Goggin said: “Once the UK leaves the Customs Union, it will become a third country and products from the UK will be treated the same as products which have originated from any other non-EU country, such as China or the United States.”
She said businesses that buy from a UK-based supplier will have to “comply with specific importers’ obligations under the relevant product safety regulations”.
“As we prepare for Brexit, we are working to raise awareness of these important changes,” Goggin added.
Business Minister Heather Humphreys said companies need to take urgent action in this regard.
“Although the situation for many businesses remains unpredictable, the reality is we are quickly approaching October 31,” Humphreys said.
She added that supporting businesses and citizens to prepare for Brexit is a high priority for the government.
“We have been working hard to put a range of supports in place to help firms identify the actions they need to take now to prepare. I am strongly urging all businesses to avail of the resources we have made available to them,” Humphreys said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/supreme-court-prorogation-4812359-Sep2019/,"HEARINGS ARE SET to take place in the UK Supreme Court today over Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament earlier this month.
Last week,a Scottish court ruled that this prorogation was unlawfulbut that will be put to the test in the UK Supreme Court in London today. The High Court in England had previously ruled in favour of Johnson’s government.
It comes after unsuccessful talks yesterday for the British prime minister with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.
Critics have accused Johnson of attempting to stymie parliament and prevent opponents from delaying Brexit with the current deadline of 31 October only a few weeks away.
A judge in Scotland’s highest civil court said in their ruling: “The only inference that could be drawn was that the UK government and the prime minister wished to restrict parliament.”
His government, however, has said that parliament is dissolved yearly at the end of every session and that Johnson was simply clearing the way for a new agenda following Theresa May’s resignation in July.
A defeat for Johnson would leave him open to charges that he has effectively lied to Queen Elizabeth II, who gave the formal order to suspend parliament.

The House of Commons has passed a law forcing him to ask the other European leaders for a delay if no compromise emerges from an 17-18 October EU summit in Brussels.
Johnson, however, has said he’d rather be “dead in a ditch” than not leave the EU on 31 October and has hinted that he would still aim at leaving on that date with or without a deal.
Court proceedings could last until Thursday and the timing of any ruling is uncertain.
No progress
After yesterday’s meeting with EU figures, Juncker said that Johnson was reminded that “it is the UK’s responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions” to the existing divorce deal that the British parliament refuses to accept.
“Such proposals have not yet been made.”
Johnson countered that there was a “good chance” of striking a new agreement if there was “movement” from Brussels.
“If we can get that done, we’re at the races,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/good-friday-agreement-dup-sinn-fein-rory-montgomery-4812195-Sep2019/,"THE GOOD FRIDAY Agreement has been under “grave pressure” for years ever since Sinn Fein and the DUP took over top roles in the Northern Ireland government, a senior negotiator of the agreement has said.
Speaking at an event in Trinity College Dublin this evening, a former top official in the Department of Foreign Affairs, Rory Montgomery, who helped negotiate the Good Friday Agreement, warned that Sinn Féin and the DUP had both damaged the principles of “understanding and reconciliation” that underpinned the document.
Montgomeryretired fromthe Department of Foreign Affairs earlier this year.
Ever since the 2016 referendum in the UK, many have warned that Brexit has threatened the landmark 1998 peace agreement. These fears have increased in recent months as concern has grown that the UK is heading towards a no-deal exit.
Montgomery told the audience that while Brexit had “damaged the fabric of the Good Friday Agreement”, it had been under strain long before the 2016 vote.
Former SDLP leader John Hume’s vision of understanding and reconciliation, Montgomery said, had been put “under grave pressure ever since the DUP and Sinn Féin took over the running of the executive”.

In 2007, after years of negotiations to end direct rule, then-DUP leader Ian Paisley and Sinn Féin’s Martin McGuinness were sworn in as first and deputy first ministers in Stormont.
Northern Ireland has been without a government for nearly three years after Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister over a row with the DUP.
Since then, concerns have grown that the region is againheading towardsdirect rule from London.
“The Good Friday Agreement was entirely a top down process,” he said this evening, adding that grassroots movements played only a small role in solving the decades-long violence.
“It wasn’t until political leadership was exercised,” he said, that action was taken to end the conflict.
The event, part of the university’s ‘Behind the Headlines’ series of talks, saw a panel discuss the future of Ireland and the prospect of a border poll.
Alongside Montgomery, speakers included award-winning Northern Irish writer Jan Carson and Trinity law professor Dr David Kenny, as well as Trinty’s Dr Etain Tannam, an expert on British-Irish relations.
Kenny and Tannam, alongside academics from the UK and Northern Ireland, are involvedin a new projectexamining the practicalities of a border poll and a united Ireland.

Diaspora referendum
Montgomery also suggested that any referendum on giving Irish people living abroad a vote in the presidential election might not pass.
Such a referendum has long been promisedbut has been besetby delays. The Sunday Business Postreported last weekendthat the referendum would be delayed again by Brexit.
Describing it as a “sensitive question”, he said that “potentially you have far more people interested in voting living in Northern than living in Britain, let alone in the the US or France or wherever”.
Adding that he was interested to see if such a referendum would succeed, he said he wasn’t “100% sure it will”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-brexit-blocking-mps-4766312-Aug2019/,"
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said Brussels and Brexit-blocking MPs were guilty of a “terrible collaboration” that would force the UK towards a no-deal exit from the EU.
He accused the EU of taking an uncompromising position towards London because it believes Brexit can be stopped in the British parliament.
Taking questions from the public live on Facebook – a first for a British PM -  Johnson said Brussels needed to compromise to avoid the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October.
It came after former finance minister Philip Hammond slammed Johnson’s “wrecking” approach to negotiations, saying the new PM had set Brussels an impossibly high bar to meet, in demanding the complete removal of its fallback provisions.
“There’s a terrible collaboration going on between people who think they can block Brexit in parliament and our European friends,” Johnson said.
“They are not compromising at all on the withdrawal agreement … because they still think that Brexit can be blocked in parliament,” he said.
The British parliament three times rejected the divorce deal negotiated between Brussels and Johnson’s predecessor Theresa May.

Many MPs were troubled by the “backstop” – a mechanism that would keep the UK in EU customs arrangements to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Johnson said he did not want a no-deal Brexit but Brussels had to give ground in order to avoid it.
“The more they think there’s a chance Brexit can be blocked in parliament, the more adamant they are in sticking to their position,” he said.
No-deal ‘betrayal’
Earlier, Hammond said a no-deal Brexit would betray Britain’s 2016 decision to leave the EU.
Hammond, who quit as chancellor just hours before Johnson took over from May on 24 July, said there was no popular or parliamentary mandate for a no-deal Brexit, saying most people wanted an orderly exit from the EU.
“No-deal would be a betrayal of the 2016 referendum result. It must not happen,” he wrote in The Times newspaper.
He said it could turn Britain into “a diminished and inward-looking little England”.
Hammond said the shift of position from seeking changes to the backstop to demanding its complete removal “is a pivot from a tough negotiating stance to a wrecking one”.
Related ReadsCast-iron and vital, or an anti-democratic bureaucracy: what is the Irish backstop?What will a no-deal Brexit mean for Ireland?
“This is a demand the EU cannot, and will not, accede to,” he wrote.
“It’s time for our government to demonstrate its commitment to a genuine negotiation with the EU to achieve a deal.”
Hammond said a no-deal Brexit would risk breaking up of the UK.
He also warned that if parliament wanted to go down a particular route to prevent a no-deal Brexit, the means would emerge to allow that to happen.
John Bercow, the speaker of parliament’s lower House of Commons, warned separately he would “fight … with every bone in my body” against any attempt by Johnson to suspend parliament to force through no-deal against MPs’ wishes.
The Commons “must have its way”, he told an audience at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, according to The Daily Telegraph newspaper.

For the two other roles on offer, that of Senior Policy Advisers for Alternative Arrangements, it says the posts “will play a crucial role in developing and delivering the UK’s policy on alternative arrangements to the Northern Ireland backstop”.
Interestingly, it says:
“We are looking for two Senior Policy Advisers who will lead the work of the team coordinating these groups, working closely with departments and delivering to tight deadlines.
“The work stream is exceptionally high profile, and you will engage closely with Ministers, senior officials and a significant range of wider stakeholders.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS laid out its financial plans for responding to the impact of Brexit, with a total package of €1.2 billion.
This is broken down into three main headings:€650 millionto support agriculture, enterprise and tourism sectors, and to help stabalise the worst affected regions;€365 millionin Social Protection measures; and€45 millionfor “labour market activation supports”.
It’s estimated that Ireland’s GDP would shrink by 0.6% in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and that around 100,000 jobs would be at risk, 10,000 in the tourism sector.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe,announcing Budget 2020 measures today, said the government must increase the level and range of supports to ensure the economy is protected.
“I hope to never access the billion euro in funding,” Tánaiste Simon Coveney said at a Brexit briefing afterwards, adding that it was a strange thing to say on Budget Day.
“This Budget has been framed by Brexit,” said Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee, who asked people and businesses to engage in Brexit preparations if they hadn’t yet done so.
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Irish government will intervene to further protect the economy, and this will be with borrowed money.
If the country does not need it, the government will not borrow it, Donohoe stressed – but added that a no-deal Brexit was its “central scenario”.
If Ireland is faced with a no-deal situation,€650 millionwill be made available to support the most vulnerable sectors -agriculture, enterprise and tourism- and to assist the most affected citizens and regions in the country.
Of this,€220 millionof that fund will be deployed immediately after a no-deal Brexit. It will be divided into two streams: onean enterprise streamto fund “limited, targeted interventions for vulnerable but viable enterprises”; andan agriculture streamto fund “time limited interventions for the beef and fishing fleet”.
€200 millionin funds will be available next year no matter the outcome of Brexit.

Preparation has already been made for Brexit in three sectors, but additional funding has been allocated in this budget to continue that progress: to increase staff at a number of departments and agencies (an extra €50m); upgrade infrastructure at ports and airports (an extra €160m), and invest in technology and facilities management (an extra €110m).
“This is to ensure we are ready for Brexit, whatever form it takes,” Donohoe said.

The€110 millionfor enterprises has been identified for the first wave of funding for targeted new interventions to help vulnerable firms adjust.
“These interventions will support firms of all sizes at all levels of difficulty with a particular focus on sectors most exposed, including food, manufacturing and internationally traded services,” he said.
Support will be by way of grants, loans and equity investment and will include:
Funding of €14 million was already made available for the Department of Enterprise to hire Brexit staff in 2017, 2018, and 2019.
This is separate from EU funding that will also be available – such as the European Globalisation Fund and the Solidarity Fund.

€110mwill be provided through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the event of a no-deal Brexit, which Minister Michael Creed said was the Department “most exposed by Brexit”.
In 2018, the Department’s exports were worth over €14 billion, of which €5.2 billion was exported to the UK market.
“We have 300,000 tonnes of beef – over 50% of all the production – going to the UK market,” he said adding that tariffs posed a “very significant exposure and additional cost for our exports of beef into the UK”.
Minister of State Michael D’Arcy said the provision of immediate supports for the beef sector will be the first priority in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

This will focus on:
“Tourism is a sector that has already begun to feel the effects of Brexit,” Transport Minister Shane Ross said.
“Since the UK referendum result, the weakening of sterling has meant that this year, the revenue for British visitors is likely to be over €100 million less than it was in 2016.”
Fáilte Ireland have estimated that a no-deal Brexit would cost the sector €380 million, with 10,000 jobs losses. In this case, the Department and agencies would work to attract tourists from Europe and North America, as well as other markets. They would also put an emphasis on regions that suffer the most in a no-deal Brexit.

Donohoe said€365 millionwill be also provided for extra social protection expenditure to support thoseat risk of losing their jobsor who have lost them as a result of a no-deal Brexit.
A further€45 millionwill be rolled out to assist people to transition tonew work.
It had been planned that the minimum wage would be increased by 30 cent to €10.10, but Minister Regina Doherty said at a briefing this evening that it has been deferred – Cabinet has given its approval, but it won’t be implemented until a no-deal Brexit is avoided.
The Finance Minsiter said he believes these supports will be sufficient but if the impact is more severe than anticipated, they are prepared to use resources that would otherwise have been dedicated to the Rainy Day Fund.
He said his original intention was to transfer €500 million to the fund from the Exchequer this year, with an additional €1.5 billion being transferred from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.
He said the €1.5 billion will still be transferred, but he has decided not to add the €500 million from the Exchequer to the fund.
“This is the appropriate response to the more challenging economic environment we may be facing,” he said.
“It will ensure that we have in place the right supports so that our economy is protected from the impacts of Brexit and it ensures that government can continue to protect our public services in the years ahead.”

PROTESTERS wielding pro-democracy placards and EU flags rallied today in dozens of British cities against Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament weeks before Brexit.
In the biggest demonstration, thousands of whistle-blowing, drum-banging people gathered outside the gates of Downing Street in London chanting “Boris Johnson shame on you!”
“I’m absolutely disgusted by what’s happening here,” said attendee Maya Dunn, 66, a Dutch citizen living in Britain, who accused Johnson of “riding roughshod over everybody”.
“You just can’t trust him,” she said.
In London, participants heard speeches from opposition politicians on a stage erected on Whitehall before marching through Westminster. Some held hand-written signs reading “defend democracy: resist the parliament shutdown” and “wake up UK! Or welcome to Germany 1933″.
Organisers using the slogan #StopTheCoup claimed as many as 100,000 people had turned out in London.
Crowds gathered in cities all over Britain, from Exeter in the southwest and Oxford in central England, to Manchester, York and Newcastle.
They also rallied in Glasgow and Edinburgh in Scotland and in Belfast.
“Nobody voted for a dictatorship,” said Bridie Walton, 55, in Exeter, who added Brexit had prompted her to demonstrate for the first time in her life.
“These are the actions of a man who is afraid his arguments will not stand scrutiny.”

‘Plenty of time’
Earlier today, Chanceller of the Exchequer Sajid Javid has said he supports Johnson’s move.
Speaking toBBC Radio 4, Javidsaid there will still be “plenty of time for debate” when parliament sits again.
“It’s right, because we are focusing on the people’s priorities, we’ve already made a number of announcements and I think there’s been a really good start,” he said.
“But to really focus, just like every other new prime minister, this prime minister wants to set out his plans and his agenda and it is perfectly normal to do that with a Queen’s speech.”
Javid said when parliament does come back, there will be three weeks to debate issues, “including, of course, I hope by then that we’ve got a deal from the EU and if we have we can put that to parliament”.
He said if a deal cannot be agreed then parliament will debate how to get the country through a no-deal situation.

Johnson warns MPs
Johnson has promised to lead Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without an agreement with Brussels.
He has said he is ready to strike a deal as long as provisions for Britain to stay in the customs union even after Brexit are cut from an existing deal struck by his predecessor Theresa May.
However, EU leaders have said they are still awaiting concrete proposals from London.
Johnson’s Brexit adviser David Frost is expected to return to Brussels for talks next week.
Opposition MPs and some lawmakers from Johnson’s own Conservatives want him to delay Brexit beyond 31 October if he fails to strike an agreement with the EU.
The UK government, meanwhile, is ramping up preparations in case of no-deal.
Johnson yesterday cautioned MPs against trying to hamper his plans, saying a decision to delay Brexit again would do “lasting damage” to public trust in politics.
He said the opposition’s efforts could in fact help lead to a no-deal Brexit as EU counterparts would be less likely to offer a compromise if they believed Brexit could be stopped.
Back in Ireland, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has called on the British government torecommend viable alternatives to the backstopto the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator as quickly as possible.
Coveney met with British foreign secretary Dominic Raab yesterday morning.

A spokesman for the Tánaiste said that he reiterated Ireland’s position on the withdrawal agreement and said the red lines agreed between the EU and UK were not negotiable.
He also urged the British government to bring forward any viable alternatives to the backstop, which achieve the same goal of no hard border or related infrastructure on the island of Ireland, to EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier as quickly as possible.
1.6 million signatures
Queen Elizabeth II gave her approval to Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament for several weeks on Wednesday. This instantly sparked widespread outrage, legal challenges and promises of resistance from parliamentarians.
The move was widely seen as a way of limiting the time Johnson’s opponents have to organise against him.
The main opposition Labour Party has said it is also considering a no-confidence vote in Johnson’s Conservative government, which commands a fragile 320 to 319 majority.
An online petition calling for the government to reverse its suspension has garnered 1.6 million signatures.
In the courts, a Scottish judge is expected to hear a legal challenge against the suspension on Tuesday. This is the same day MPs return from their summer break for their shortened parliamentary session.
There will be a separate court hearing on Thursday for another challenge that is being supported by John Major, a former Conservative prime minister and staunch opponent of Brexit.

The previous plans were for the coins to be produced for the previous Brexit deadline of 31 March but as this date was extended the coins were never issued.

https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-boris-johnson-4839068-Oct2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR is seeking to meet with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson next week.
Speaking at a Fine Gael fundraiser in Dublin tonight, he said “time is tight” for a Brexit deal to be struck ahead of a European Council summit on 17 and 18 October.
He said he believes a deal can be reached and refused to set out when Johnson should submit any final proposals to the EU, but said that next Friday was “reasonable”.
“We are in the process of trying to arrange a meeting with prime minister Johnson next week,” he added.
“Time is tight. We have a European summit on the 17th of October and it’s not reasonable to expect 27 or 28 heads of Government to sign off on something that they only see the night before or a few days before,” he said, adding:
“There are a lot of countries, for example, including our own where there’s a degree of parliamentary scrutiny. So timelines are tight.”
While he said Friday was reasonable, he said the deadlines aren’t going to be absolutely rigid.
“It is always possible to find an extra 24 hours or an extra 48 hours but it’s not the case that you can negotiate an international treaty at a council meeting in Brussels.”
He said it is legal document that 28 heads of States can’t make amendments to and discuss at 3am in the morning at a council meeting.
Asked whether he thinks a deal can be done, he said:

“It’s possible at the European Council summit in two weeks time, but the current position as of today is the European Union, including Ireland, doesn’t feel that the proposals put forward by Prime Minister Johnson yet form the basis for deeper negotiations.”
He said the Irish government had concerns about the issue of consent and democracy in the North, as well as a serious problem with custom checks.
“That is the hard border we have been trying to avoid all along,” he said.
Budget
The Taoiseach was also asked about next week’s Budget.
He said tax cuts had been delivered in the last three years, but on Tuesday he has to “what’s right for the country” in light of Brexit.
“This budget is different. It’s a no deal budget so it has to be more conservative than previous budgets and what that means is no across the board income tax cuts and no across the board welfare increases,” he said.
“But there will be room for a package of modest ones targeted on the poorest and those most in need and there will be a tax package, albeit a minimal one, correcting some anomalies and unfairnesses that need to be corrected.”
He said the exact figure of the Brexit packages still has to be settled on, but added that that it will involve a “financial package to save jobs and businesses that are viable in the long term but may be vulnerable as a consequence of Brexit”.
“So as you can imagine, the area’s most affected will be the ones most protected.
“That’s agriculture and the food industry, fisheries, also exporters’ to the UK and the tourism industry as well and we’ll have to as well have a focus on the border region, which could be very much affected too.”

According to an opinion poll conducted by Kantar/Sunday Independent, less than 43% of people polled said they were satisfied with the Taoiseach’s approach to the increasingly tricky Brexit process with 33% of that cohort saying they were “quite satisfied”.
However, 27% of people said they were not satisfied with Varadkar’s handling of the situation and a further 22% of people said they were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. 8% of people polled said they didn’t know.
The poll was conducted nationwide and also found that 72% of Ireland’s farmers were concerned with the EU Mercosur deal.

Tensions have risen between the Irish and British governments in recent days following the ascension of Boris Johnson to 10 Downing Street.
In recent days, Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney have both given statements on the current Brexit state of play following the appointment of Johnson as the British Prime Minister.
Coveney said that Johnson’s recent comments on Brexit have been“unhelpful”while the DUP has accused the Irish government of being “hysterical” and “self-centred” in its reaction to Johnson’s comments.
Meanwhile, Downing Street is preparing for a no deal Brexit.
Writing in today’s The Sunday Times, Michael Gove said there is a “very real prospect” that an agreement would not be struck with Brussels before the Halloween deadline.
“The EU’s leaders have, so far, said they will not change their approach — it’s the unreformed withdrawal agreement, take it or leave it,” Gove said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-parliament-suspended-after-mps-rejects-johnsons-second-attempt-to-call-election-4802374-Sep2019/,"THE UK PARLIAMENT will be suspended after MPs rejected Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s second attempt to call a general election.
Only 293 MPs voted for an election, with 46 voting against. It did not reach the two-thirds majority of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act in order to be passed, however.
Johnson had tried to force a 15 October general election – but the move, once again, was blocked by the opposition.
The prorogation – suspension – of parliament now takes effect for the next five weeks. Critics of Johnson have hit out at the suspension tactic saying it is a means of driving through the government’s “do or die” Brexit plans, leaving MPs with little time to debate the final Brexit outcome before 31 October deadline.
In an attempt to avert a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, however, the so-called Benn bill became law today.
Advertisement
The bill is designed to extend Article 50 and prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. It would push the current Brexit deadline of 31 October to 31 January next year at the earliest and put a ban on a no-deal Brexit on the statute books.
Speaking following the vote, Johnson said: “Once again, the opposition think they know better.”
“They want the British prime minister to go to a vital negotiation without the power to walk away. They want to delay Brexit yet again, without further reference to those who voted for it…And so now the house will move to adjourn and resume the state opening and the Queen’s speech on October 14, and I hope the opposition will use that time to reflect. Meanwhile, this government will press on with negotiating a deal.”
MPs earlier this evening backed a motion requiring the release of the government’s no-deal planning documents and documents relating to the suspension of parliament.
The motion, put forward by Dominic Grieve who lost the Conservative Party whip last week, requires the release of all internal communications, including with Boris Johnson’s controversial adviser Dominic Cummings.
Parliament is due to return on 14 October.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-general-election-brexit-4795952-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|4 Sep 2019
BRITISH MPS HAVE voted against holding a general election on 15 October.
MPs backed the government motion by 298 votes to 56 votes.
However, the required two-thirds majority (434 votes) was not met as 214 Labour Party members abstained. Three Labour MPs voted for the bill and 28 against.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson tabled the motion after MPs earlier voted in favour of a bill which, if passed in the House of Lords, will extend Brexit until at least 31 January 2020 (if a deal is not agreed by 19 October) in an attempt to avoid the UK leaving the European Union without a deal.
MPs backed the bill by327 votes to 299 votes.
Johnson said the bill was “without precedence in the history” of the House of Commons and its passage amounted to “forcing him to surrender in international negotiations”.
“I refuse to do this … therefore there is is only one way forward,” he said when announcing earlier this evening that he would push for a general election.

Speaking after the result of the election motion, Johnson said: “48 hours ago, [Corbyn] was leading the chants of, ‘Stop the coup, let the people vote’. Now he’s saying, ‘Stop the election and stop the people voting’.”
“I can only speculate as to the reasons behind his hesitation. The obvious conclusion is, I’m afraid, that he does not think he will win.”
‘Snow White’s apple’
The Labour Party earlier said it would back an election once the threat of a no-deal Brexit is removed.
Prior to the vote on the election motion, Corbyn said:
Corbyn criticised Johnson’s perceived lack of strategy, saying “he can’t tell us what it is”, adding: “The bigger problem for him is that he hasn’t told the EU what it is either.”
“At prime minister’s question time today, as with the statement yesterday, he was unable to say whether he has even made any proposals whatsoever to the EU.
“Basically, it’s a policy cloaked in mystery like the emperor’s new clothes. There really is absolutely nothing there,” Corbyn added.

https://www.thejournal.ie/supreme-court-boris-johnson-4821912-Sep2019/,"THE UK SUPREME Court will today rule on whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in suspending parliament, in a major test for his premiership with the Brexit deadline of 31 October still looming.
If the verdict goes against Johnson, it could see parliament rapidly reassemble and would inevitably trigger questions about his position, having unlawfully advised Queen Elizabeth II to suspend parliament.
It would be the latest hammer blow to his plans for taking Britain out of the European Union next month, and pile huge pressure on his minority government.
Speaking in New York last night, however, he said the reasons for proroguing parliament and wanting a Queen’s Speech – an event where the monarch formally outlines the priorities of the government – were “very good indeed”.
He insisted that when parliament returns in the middle of next month, it will have “bags of time to scrutinise the deal that I hope we’ll be able to do [with the EU]“.
Today’s decision in London will follow two prior court decisions. The highest civil court in Scotland previously ruled that suspending parliament was unlawful while the English High Court said it was not a matter for judges.
The Supreme Court must therefore decide whether it even has the power to rule on such a case, before coming to any decision on the legality of the move.
David Pannick, representing campaigners appealing against the High Court ruling, argued that judges had the right to decide the proper scope of the prime minister’s power to advise the head of state on shuttering parliament.
“This five-week prorogation has prevented parliament from carrying out its scrutiny functions over the executive over a period of exceptional length… for no rational reason,” he said.
Advertisement
But Advocate General Richard Keen, the British government’s top Scottish legal advisor, said it would see the courts straying into an “ill-defined minefield”.
“This is forbidden territory. It is a matter between the executive and parliament.”
What could happen?
The 11 judges each express their own view, and have broadly five options.
They could decide it is not a matter for the courts, or decide it is within their scope but that Johnson acted lawfully.
They could rule that he acted unlawfully, but that the period of prorogation was not in itself unreasonable, meaning Johnson could decide to prorogue again in a lawful manner.
If they find he acted unlawfully and that he suspended parliament for an unreasonably long time, he will be obliged to recall parliament.
The court could also decide that because the prorogation was not lawful, it never really happened, meaning parliament remains in session.
The Supreme Court will begin delivering its judgement at 10.30am this morning, ahead of a meeting due to take place later between Johnson and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.

https://www.thejournal.ie/angela-merkel-hunt-4674601-Jun2019/,"BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY Jeremy Hunt has said that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated the EU would be willing to renegotiate the UK’s Brexit deal.
Hunt has thrown his hat in the ring to succeed Theresa May as Prime Minister, and told Sky News today that he’d spoken with Merkel at this week’s D-Day commemorations.
“She said that of course with a new British prime minister we would want to look at any solutions you have,” he said.
Hunt didn’t specify if he was referring to the legally-binding withdrawal agreement that the Irish government and the EU have repeatedly said can’t be re-opened, or the accompanying political declaration on future relations.
Brussels has said the declaration could be revisited if Britain makes a substantive change in its positions, for example on a customs union or access to the single market.
May agreed the package with the EU last year but saw it rejected three times by MPs in the House of Commons, forcing her to delay Brexit twice – the latest extension being to 31 October.
Those vying to succeed May have all been positioning their stances on Brexit and Hunt’s intervention here comes alongside rival Sajid Javid’s claimthat Britain should pay Ireland half a billion pounds to break the deadlock on the Northern Irish backstop.
Hunt claimed Merkel had signalled EU leaders may now be open to a technological solution to the thorny issue – something that Ireland and the EU have previously ruled out as unrealistic.
“She said to me Germany doesn’t have that border with the Republic of Ireland, you do… so you need to come up with the solution,” he said of their conversation.

“So it’s going to be a solution that’s based around some technologies — what the Germans call intelligent border(s). I think that’s doable.”
Jockeying for position
Front-runner to become the next Prime Minister is Boris Johnson, and he said in an interview with the Sunday Times today he would refuse to pay Britain’s £39 billion divorce bill until the EU agrees better withdrawal terms.
The ex-London mayor also signalled he would scrap the much-despised backstop and try to settle the border issue once London and Brussels were negotiating their future relationship.
“Our friends and partners need to understand that the money is going to be retained until such time as we have greater clarity about the way forward,” he said.
“In getting a good deal, money is a great solvent and a great lubricant,” Johnson added.
Faring less well in the leadership battle is Michael Gove, who’s faced a backlash since admitting to using cocaine “on several occasions at social events” two decades ago.
“I do have a profound sense of regret about it all and I am very, very aware of the damage that drugs do,” he told the BBC on Sunday.
The former justice minister has faced accusations of hypocrisy for having continually supported tough drug laws, while a former senior drug adviser to the government warned the admission could see him barred from entering the United States under its strict anti-drugs immigration laws.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-promises-good-solution-to-irish-border-in-formal-brexit-plan-4831730-Oct2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS urged the European Union to work with him on efforts to reach a Brexit deal when he presents formal proposals to break the deadlock within days.
The Prime Minister said it is now the moment when the “rubber hits the road” as the clock ticks down to the 31 October scheduled date for the UK’s exit from the EU.
Johnson called for Brussels, Dublin and Berlin to work with him on the “good solution” the UK will be formally setting out.
Johnson’s comments come after Irish political leadersrejectedproposals for customs posts along both sides of the Irish border to replace the backstop.
It was reported yesterday evening that the UK has – as part of a broader set of proposals – suggested creating a set of customs posts along both sides of the Irish border.
The UK and the EU have been at loggerheads over the backstop, which Brexit supporters say is unacceptable.
The proposals would also create a “customs clearance site” in the North that could be monitored using GPS or tracking devices on trucks.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney described the so-called “non-paper” as a “non-starter” and said it was time the European Union had “a serious proposal” from the UK government if a deal was to be achieved before the 31 October deadline.
Coveney added that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland “deserves better”.

‘Very good offer’
The prospect of customs posts returning to the area around the border has been one of the most recurring fears since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016.

There have been repeated warnings that infrastructure along the border could become a target for dissident violence.
But Johnson said these were preliminary ideas that had been floated and the formal proposals would be set out very shortly – widely expected to be later this week, after the Tory conference finishes tomorrow.
“They are not talking about the proposals we are going to be tabling, they are talking about stuff that went in previously,” he told the BBC.
“But clearly this is the moment when the rubber hits the road. This is when the hard yards really are in the course of the negotiations.
“The difficulty really is going to be around the customs union and to what extent Northern Ireland can be retained within EU bodies at all.
“We’re going to make a very good offer, we are going to be tabling it very soon, but there is a difficulty if you try to keep Northern Ireland in a customs union because one of the basic things about being a country is you have a single customs perimeter and a single customs union,” Johnson said.
In an indication of why the UK has delayed tabling its formal proposals, Johnson said there was a risk that critics could “needlessly distort” what was being put forward.
“We do think there’s a good solution. I very much hope that our European and EU friends in Brussels, in Dublin, in Germany as well, will want to take it forward,” he said.
‘Utterly unworkable’
In response to the so-called “non-papers”, Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “If Boris Johnson had spent any time listening to businesses and communities in Northern Ireland, he would know that these proposals are utterly unworkable.”
He added: “If accurate, these proposals represent yet another failure of the Government’s negotiating strategy.
“The Prime Minister should admit he has no credible plan for Brexit and that the only way to resolve this issue is to go back to the people with a public vote.”
Meanwhile, The Times reported that Mr Johnson’s plan to get around the Benn Act – the law aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit without MPs’ approval – would be to ask EU leaders to rule out any extension to the October 31 deadline.
He would then seek to present MPs in Parliament with a straight choice of agreeing the revised deal or leaving without an agreement on Halloween.","9.03am, 1 Oct 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/backstop-northern-ireland-dup-boris-brexit-4803996-Sep2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson met with the DUP in Downing Street this evening.
Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, said that Johnson had ruled out the idea of a Northern Ireland-only backstop.
A backstop, solely for Northern Ireland,has been mootedas one option that could break the impasse between the UK and the EU over the issue of the border.
The idea was raised earlier in negotiations between the UK and the EU as a way to avoid a hard border. However, in February 2018 Theresa May ruled out the idea.

“History teaches us that any deal relating to Northern Ireland which cannot command cross community support is doomed to failure. That is why the Northern Ireland backstop is flawed,” Foster said in a statement after the meeting.
“Not one single unionist MLA in the Northern Ireland Assembly supports it,” she said.
Foster, whose party has been in a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservative Party since the 2017 election, has consistently sought to ensure that any Brexit deal does not leave Northern Ireland with a separate regulatory system to that of the rest of the UK.
A Northern Ireland-only backstop, Foster said, is “undemocratic and unconstitutional and would place a tariff border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom”.
Foster said that her party wanted a “sensible deal” and that they were “encouraged by the tone and language in Dublin on Monday”.
Yesterday, Johnsonmet with Taoiseach Leo Varadkarto discuss Brexit and the backstop. Johnson said that he wanted to secure a deal with the EU and that a no-deal exit would be a “failure of state-craft”.

His decision to prorogue parliament, which triggered legal action and protests, has also been widely criticised both in the UK and internationally.
While the DUP is still technically provides key element of parliamentary support for Johnson, the expulsion of 21 Tory rebels means that the government does not possess a working majority in the House of Commons – even with the support of Arlene Foster’s party.
Foster said that Johnson today confirmed his “commitment to securing a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom as well as our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland”.

The group has campaigned against a return to a hard border in Ireland since the UK voted to leave the EU.

The spokesperson did not confirm where these vehicles would be used.

Speaking during his visit to Belfast today, Varadkar said that he didn’t accept that no-deal was “unavoidable”.
“There are many ways by which no-deal can be avoided, either at the ratification of the withdrawal agreement, further extension or revocation of Article 50,” he said.
Since taking over as UK prime minister, Boris Johnson has taken a more hardline approach to diplomacy with the EU, includingwith Ireland, prompting concerns that a no-deal Brexit was becoming more likely than a negotiated UK exit from the EU.
“There is always room for talks and negotiations,” he added. The EU, he added, has always been willing to make clarifications or make changes to the political declaration element of the Withdrawal Agreement.

Varadkar also re-iterated that he had invited Johnson to Dublin for discussions on Brexit.
He also warned that, whatever happens, Brexit doesn’t end on 31 October.
“If we have no deal, we’re going to have to talk,” Varadkar said. “We are still in discussions with the European Commission about how to deal with a no-deal Brexit.”
Tonight, Varadkar will take part in a leaders debate as part of the Féile an Phobail festival with Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, DUP MP Gregory Campbell and Fianna Fáil’s Brendan Smith, alongside representatives of Northern Ireland’s main parties.

Northern Ireland is expected to be hardest hit by Brexit, while the issue of the border and the backstop has been a major sticking point in negotiations between the EU and the UK.
In a statement today, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: “With the clock counting down towards 31 October, it is time for Dublin and Brussels to engage constructively and work for a deal which respects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom.”

She also said that the US was closely aligned with Ireland, so any possibility of a US-UK trade relationship post-Brexit wasn’t likely if Ireland or the Good Friday Agreement was negatively affected.
“People are very serious about Ireland in the United States – don’t mess with it, don’t make it look bad.”
Labour MP Stephen Pound – a shadow minister for Northern Ireland who haspreviously been applauded for his understanding of Irish issues– agrees with Greer’s comments. Speaking toTheJournal.ieyesterday, he said:
He said that “knuckle-dragging little Englander’s traditional view of ignorant Irish people is more visible in the rear view mirror”, and that those derogatory views of Irish people were disappearing.
“The marvellously comical, jovial, cheerful jokes about Irish people and leprechauns, and the Gaeltacht being where the wild people live, that view has disappeared now.”

The UK is “recalibrating the relationship in many ways”: “since the horrors that the British border inflicted”, Pound says, this is the last throw of the dice of colonialism and “we’re approaching a state of equality”.
“What’s changing is the Irish themselves are confident,” Pound says.
In the one defence of the derogatory British view of the Irish, Pound says that the “transposed thick rural peasant jokes” are everywhere – in every nation and region. Pound says he was “brought up on Kerryman jokes” made by his mother’s Cork relatives.

Speaking to Channel 4 News last year,Pound’s comments on the Irish borderbeing a “life or death” matter went viral. He also spoke in detail about why the Swedish/Norway option – which has been freshly ruled out by the Taoiseach this week – wouldn’t work in Ireland.
“If you look at the border, 302 miles long, if you think that a camera up a pole can actually provide a border security alert – that will become a target.
Because of this, Pound has ruled out Boris Johnson’s backstop alternative.
“The latest proposals from Johnson says much more about management within the Conservative party. I still favour an all-island customs union for the whole of Ireland – if it means customs check between Great Britain and Northern Ireland then so be it. But basically, this deal is Theresa May Mark Two.”
Elaborating on his all-island customs union, Pound says:
“An all-island solution is where we’re headed. You had Bord Fáilte and the Council of Education, Recruitment and Training merge into Fáilte Ireland, an all-island tourism body; the Irish rugby team; and so many environmental controls, so the impetus is towards an all-island solution.
He says that he’s not looking for a silver lining, but that Brexit has “brought the issue [of the border] into sharp focus – people are now looking past Winston Churchill’s description of ‘the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone‘.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/budget-2020-4836086-Oct2019/,"LAST UPDATE|4 Oct 2019
FINANCE MINISTER PASCHAL Donohoe said today that there is a real material risk of a no-deal Brexit and that this year’s budget is based on that.
Ahead of the government’s White Paper being published, which sets out the finances ahead of next week, the minister told reporters that €450 million in supplementary estimates will be needed.
There is also an additional surplus of €600 million this year, the paper will confirm.
A rainy-day fund will be put in place, according to Donohoe. €1.5 billion will be moved into it, but the minister ruled out adding in an extra €500 million as he would have to borrow money to do so.
Earlier today, Fianna Fáil claimed there is actually far less money to spend in this year’s Budget compared to what was published in theSummer Economic Statement.
Speaking about the ongoing Budget talks with Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath said his party went into Budget discussions on the assumption that there was €700 million in fiscal space (the amount of money there for tax cuts or new spending measures).
While McGrath would not be pushed on what the final figure is, he said:
“It’s very limited”.

McGrath said Fianna Fáil went into the negotiations on the basis of the “information given to date that we were looking at an overall budget of around €2.8 billion, of which 2.1 billion was pre-committed, leaving headroom of about €700 million for package of budgetary decision”.
“But it seems to us that when the Minister for Finance gets into discussions with the various departments, and the picture is very different indeed. And the amount of money actually needed at a standstill, before you make a new policy decisions, is far greater than the €2.1 billion euro. And that is certainly an issue,” he said.
“The headroom for new measures is very, very limited,” he said, adding that the published figures in the Summer Economic Statement are not accurate.
Sitting around the table, McGrath said they were presented with a “different picture” during the course of the talks than presented in the Summer Economic Status in terms of the headroom available. I think it’s fair to say that, and that will be shown next week,” he said.
However, when asked about the matter today, the finance minister denied this, stating he would be making reference to the €700 million fiscal space in his Budget speech.
Overspend
McGrath said underestimations by departments on what they need and the overspend in the health budget has eaten into the pot.
Today, Donohoe confirmed that supplementary budgets will be required, such as in health.
“The Department of Health will have a total overall supplementary that will be very significantly reduced from where it has been in previous years, myself and the Minister for Health put a massive amount of effort into dealing with this issue. And we’re meeting again tonight,” he said.
Outlining how it is going to be paid for, the minister said there is an over performance on a number of tax sets at the moment at which will contribute to bailing out the health budget. Underspends by some government departments will also be used to fill the gap, and on Budget day, Donohoe said he will be outling his plans regarding how this could be paid for in a sustainable way, he said.
This comes down to the running of the Department of Finance, “being in control and ensuring the figures we publish can be stood over, and in this case, they can’t”, said McGrath.
McGrath said today the the process is far less advanced now than it has been for the previous three years. Donohoe said talks would continue into the weekend.

Setting out some of Fianna Fáil’s asks, McGrath and Barry Cowen said they want to see improvements in home care packages for the elderly, school places for those with special needs, as well as the ring-fencing of the carbon tax.

Social Protection not signed off on
All eyes will be on the social protection package, which McGrath said the government hasn’t yet presented to them yet. Fianna Fáil’s Willie O’Dea has called for increases to the pension, but the government has indicated it is a non-runner.

Donohoe said the social protection package will be “smaller in scale and will be targeted”.  He said there are a few small options that he is considering.
However, McGrath said today that “nothing is off the table” regarding social welfare rates.
McGrath says there is “some scope” for tax cuts, something the Taoiseach indicated last week.
Pressure has been mounting on the minister to dip into the corporation tax windfall, which was announced this week, to fund opposition demands.
With such a small pot to go around, it is understood that pressure is mounting on Donohoe to dip into the government’s corporate tax take, which is almost 11% ahead of target at €5.84 billion for the first nine months of the year.
McGrath said Fianna Fáil are taking Fine Gael “at their word” that there is no “rabbit to be pulled out of a hat” on Budget day, as there was last year, when additional funds was found by government.
Today, the minister confirmed that he would be using “some” of the corporation tax take to pay for supplementary estimates.
However, he said he will also be outlining next week how they plan to wean the government of relying on Ireland’s corporation tax take, which has been dubbed unstainable and risky money to rely on going into the future by many economists and think tanks.
Brexit budget
With just four days until Budget Day, some parties have said they are “not happy one bit” in how it has all played out.
Donohoe has already described how the upcoming Budget will be “safe” and warned that in light of Brexit, there isn’t much money to play with this year.
Unlike other years, Donohoe had to consider two scenarios when drafting this year’s Budget.
One, in which there is a real possibility of ano-deal Brexit, and the other, in which it is all relatively smooth sailing after the Brexit deadline of 31 October.
Due to the deadlock over the Irish backstop, the minister has decided to err on the side of caution, and opted for Budget option A, in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit.

Not getting a lot
With Fine Gael in a confidence and supply arrangement with Fianna Fáil, as well as having the Independent Alliance as partners in government, the finance minister has a tricky job of balancing expectations and delivering a prudent Brexit budget, while also ensuring no one walks away from the table.
Last week,TheJournal.iereportedthat the Independent Alliance was insisting that the inheritance tax threshold be raised, which is the amount that parents can leave to their children when they die without the children paying tax on it.
However, sources in Fianna Fáil has insisted it is a non-runner, due to the frugality of this year’s Budget.
This is just one demand that is being fought for in the talks. Others include affordable housing, insurance industry levies, pension increases, climate action policies, and disability payments.
It is believed that items both parties thought were a certainty have had question marks placed over them by the finance minister, with one source close to the talks stating that Donohoe has said if there is no agreement on what is on offer by today, he is simply going to tell people what they are getting.
With Donohoe appearing to be putting his foot down in a bid to get things wrapped up by the weekend, all eyes will be on Fianna Fáil and the Independent Alliance in terms of how they react to such a harsh move.
While parties could simply walk away, throwing the Budget into chaos, a source said that is unlikely to happen. Nobody wants to be seen “throwing the toys out of the pram” when Ireland is in the middle of Brexit drama.

https://www.thejournal.ie/richard-pym-brexit-boris-sterling-crisis-macgill-4735017-Jul2019/,"THE UK IS facing into a “good old-fashioned Sterling crisis” post-Brexit, according to chairman of AIB, Richard Pym.
Speaking at the MacGill Summer School in Donegal yesterday, Pym gave hiscandid viewson Boris Johnson, the favourite to be announced as the new UK Prime Minister later today.
He told the audience that he would not hire Johnson if he was interviewing him for a role on the bank’s board, citing his ‘uncombed hair’, ‘questionably racist language’ and being dismissed from two previous roles.
Pym said he would be abandoning “non-committal business-person language” for his speech because “we are in the fight for our lives”.
Financial crisis
He said Brexiteers argue that the UK will benefit from leaving the EU, but he believes  the country is facing into some very real financial problems post-Brexit, and could likely experience a Sterling crisis.
Holding up his own British passport at the podium in Glenties, he said the EU project was based upon upholding peace, and that peace between Britain and Ireland could not have been achieved outside of the European Union.
Although he noted the economic threat posed by Brexit, Pym also said that “Ireland can benefit from Brexit as it absorbs economic activity displaced from the UK.”
The AIB chair said many Brexit campaigners “dream of a closer trade association with the USA building on the already close political association between US Republicans and UK Conservatives”.
Whilst the price would be the partial destruction of British farming, the opportunity of free trade with the USA would offset the trade loss with the EU, he added.

Former Conservative and UKIP MP, Douglas Carswell, who was also in attendance at the discussion on Brexit, said Ireland is failing to understand the reasons behind Euroscepticism in Britain.
He said “mocking” and “pitying” those that voted to leave the EU is not facing up to the “flaws” inherent in the EU political system.
Carswell said such “comfort blanket thinking” has now resulted in a no-deal Brexit being the most likely possibility.
Concessions on the backstop
He said if “minor concessions” were made by Ireland on the backstop, such as accepting a time limit, Theresa May’s deal may have been voted through.
“Instead you now have Boris, and a no-deal is now more likely,” he said, adding that in 15 weeks time, Britain will most likely leave with a no-deal.
He disagreed with the view of the AIB chair that the UK is facing serious issues, countering that the EU model has been bad for growth and innovation.
Britain post-Brexit will flourish, said Carswell, a comment which drew a titter of laughter from the audience. He added: “I think a time limit on the backstop is the obvious way forward.”
Carswell said he did regret that Brexit had spawned a “very nasty, nasty, nasty culture war that has been waged”. He feared it had created “two tribes” in the UK, similar to a divide that exists between US Democrats and Conservatives in the US.
“That bothers me enormously,” he said.
During the same session, Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokesperson Lisa Chambers said a no-deal Brexit “would plunge the UK into recession, shrink the economy, trigger a fall in Sterling, a rise in unemployment; slow wage growth and deter investment”.
“Against the backdrop of sterling falling last week Jacob Rees-Mogg dismisses this and other projections as ‘project fear’,” she said, adding:
“A no deal Brexit will only serve to expose these issues even more.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/cummings-johnson-brexit-4826868-Sep2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON’S SENIOR advisor has said that said it’s “not surprising” that MPs are being targeted by angry members of the public over Brexit.
Saying that this is a “walk in the park” compared to the referendum in 2016, Dominic Cummings said last night that the situation “can only be resolved by parliament honouring its promise to respect the result”.
“We are enjoying this, we are going to leave and we are going to win,” he said, adding that MPs were “disconnected” from what people think “in the real world”.
Earlier, a Labour MP confronted Cummings to say he’d had “death threats overnight” to which the senior advisor replied “get Brexit done”.

Debates in the House of Commons have been filled with tension this week after the Supreme Court ruled against Johnson’s government and said that his proroguing of parliament was unlawful. It prompted a quick recall of parliament and has been characterised by angry, fractious scenes in recent days.
Cummings comments at a book launch last night double down on the prime minister’s refusal to apologise for his language against opponents, where he used words like “betrayal” and “surrender”.
Johnson also dismissed a Labour MP’s complaint that his “inflammatory” language risked provoking attacks as “humbug”.

Several MPs asked Johnsonto refrain from using such language with Tracy Brabin MP, who succeeded Cox in her former constituency, saying that members should “feel secure when we’re going about our jobs”.
In response, Johnson said: “What I will say is that the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.”
The Church of England, meanwhile, has criticised the rhetoric being used in recent days as “not worthy of our country”.
The parliamentary tensions have prompted 120 archbishops and bishops to issue a statement warning against “further entrenching our divisions”.
“We call on politicians to adhere rigorously to the rule of law and on all to respect and uphold the impartiality of the courts and our judiciary,” the statement said.
Former prime minister John Majoralso went on the attack against Johnson yesterday, accusing his party of now acting as a “Brexit Party tribute band” and that no previous government would have behaved in such a “reckless and divisive” manner.
Major said Johnson had only “lip service” to the Supreme Court ruling that the prorogation of Parliament had been unlawful and warned he could try to circumvent the law designed to prevent a no-deal break.
He said he feared the government could try to bypass the so-called Benn Act by an executive Order in Council, suspending it until after 31 October when the UK is set to leave the EU.
“I should warn the Prime Minister that – if this route is taken – it will be in flagrant defiance of Parliament and utterly disrespectful to the Supreme Court,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/labour-conference-brexit-4821684-Sep2019/,"
THE UK’S LABOUR Party conference descended into farce as it narrowly rejected a grass-roots attempt to force leader Jeremy Corbyn to campaign to remain in the European Union and reverse the outcome of the 2016 Brexit vote.
The 119-year-old party’s annual congress turned into a showdown between its irreconcilably splintered pro- and anti-Brexit wings.
Opinion polls show Corbyn’s efforts to unite the two by either delaying a decision on departure or putting it in hands of voters in a likely early election have led to a dramatic drop in support.
But a motion to force the party to “campaign energetically for a public vote and to stay in the EU in that referendum” was lost in a show-of-hands vote that appeared too close to call, to many watching in the hall.
“In my view, it was carried,” congress chair Wendy Nicholls announced after surveying the hands of 1,200 delegates packed into hall in the south coast resort city of Brighton.
“No, sorry, it was lost,” she corrected herself a moment later.
Nicholls dismissed pleas from one pro-EU delegate who jumped on stage to ask for a recount.
The result wasa triumph for the veteran socialistCorbynand a painful blow for a clutch of leaders who broke ranks and tried to turn Labour into an unambiguously pro-remain party.
Guardian News/ YouTube
“We must fight with every fibre of our beings to say between now and 31 October, and afterwards if there is a general election, that any terms of departure, from any government, must go back to the British public for the final say,” Labour’s foreign affairs spokeswoman Emily Thornberry insisted in an impassioned address.
‘Maximum consensus’
The result means that Labour will leave the conference in the same position that it came in — in favour of a second referendum but against openly campaigning for or against.

The strategy has not been working in the polls, with voters appearing to want clear options as the country races toward an 31 October exit from the EU without a plan for future trade.
Two surveys published over the weekend put Labour 15 percentage points behind Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s ruling Conservatives and in danger of losing second place to the pro-EU Liberal Democrats.

Grassroots activists spent hours deep into last night trying to come up with a single Brexit motion that could be put up for a vote at the conference on today.
They ended up with three.
They first passed a motion proposed by Corbyn and backed by the ruling executive in a secret ballot that infuriated numerous delegates over the weekend.
It sees Labour adopting no official Brexit position in the general election campaign.
But it promises to consider coming up with one “through a special one-day conference, following the election of a Labour government”.
Labour would then stage a second referendum in which voters would be given the choice of either backing a new Brexit agreement negotiated by Corbyn or staying in the EU.
The second motion was the hotly disputed attempt to get the party to adopt an official ‘Remain stance’.
A third motion was carried simply calling for a second referendum that gives “people a final say between a credible leave option and remain”.
It also forces Labour to stay neutral and focus on trying to “build maximum consensus”.

The Road Safety Authority this year spent nearly €72,000 advertising the need for UK driving licence holders living in Ireland to apply for an Irish licence before a no-deal Brexit.
In the last month, applications have nearly tripled as preparations in Ireland continue as the UK prepares to leave the EU.
According to figures obtained byTheJournal.iefollowing a freedom of information request, Road Safety Authority (RSA), which administers the National Driver Licence Service, spent €71,702 on advertising the need for people to exchange their UK licences for an Irish licence before 31 October 2019 – the date the UK is scheduled to leave the EU.
The money was spent on a range of adverts, including on local and national radio, as well as in newspapers and on social media.
While preparations between the Road Safety Authority and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on driving licences began earlier this year, since taking office UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has increased fears that the country is heading towards a no-deal exit.

In recent months, the government has beenpromoting the needfor Irish businesses and industries to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.
Onits website, the NDLS warns:
“The campaign has been highly successful in raising awareness of the need to exchange a licence in driving exchange applications themselves,” a spokesperson for the RSA said in a statement.
Last month,TheJournal.ierevealed thatover 5,000 questionsabout the status of UK driving licences in Ireland after Brexit have been sent to the National Driver Licence Service since the end of February.
Nearly 27,000UK licences have been exchanged for an Irish driving licence in 2019 – this is an increase from 6,000 in 2018.
The latest government information states that visitors from the UK or Northern Ireland will still be able to drive in Ireland following Brexit without an international driving permit.
The NDLS has also advised that anyone who lives in Northern Ireland but works across the border will still be able to drive using a UK driving licence.

Speaking before the UK Parliament’s Exiting the European Union Committee today, the Food and Drink Federation’s chief operating officer Tim Rycroft said that “because of the short shelf life, stockpiling has a limited ability to mitigate the impact” of food shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
In April, the UK and EU agreed a flexible Brexit extension until 31 October following marathon talks in Brussels. If an agreement is not met by then, the UK will leave the EU with no deal.
“Probably immediately after a no deal exit you probably wouldn’t see very much difference in the first two weeks,” Rycroft said.
Rycroft added that other more “obscure” items would also face shortages in the event of a no-deal.
“We don’t have enough milk powder processing capability in this country and that goes into a lot of products like confectionary and infant formula,” Rycroft said.
“We don’t grow enough high protein wheat in this country, we tend to rely on a lot of imported wheat for bread.”
He told the committee that such food shortages “might go on for several weeks and potentially months” following a no-deal exit from the EU.

Meanwhile, as reported byThe Guardian, Seamus Nevin, the chief economist with Make UK, warned the committee that a no-deal Brexit will be “commercial suicide”.
“There is a direct link between politicians talking up the prospect of no deal and British firms losing customers overseas and British people losing jobs,” Nevin said.
Nevin continued to tell the committee that the UK could face the prospect of businesses relocating in the event trading barriers.
“I think it’s a very clear warning that if you create trade barriers between yourselves and your biggest market you’re going to encourage businesses to relocate. We have seen that already,” Nevin said.

“Thousands of jobs have already been lost with businesses downsizing or completely shutting down in the UK,” he said, outlining that he is aware of one company that will do just that, which “will result in several thousand job losses for one individual firm”.
‘A yellow-box junction’
The committee took place as prominent Brexiteer Boris Johnson todaylaunched his campaign bidto become the leader of the Tory party and the next British Prime Minister.
In his speech, Johnson said that although he wouldn’t delay Brexit past October and that he wouldn’t rule out a no-deal Brexit – that he didn’t want to leave the EU without a deal.
“Parties have entered a yellow-box junction where they cannot move forward or back.
“After three years, and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on October 31st,” he said, sparking applause from the audience.

“I don’t think we will end up with any such thing,” adding that it was “astonishing” that British negotiators had ruled it out up to now.
“Delay means defeat, delay means Corbyn,” he added. “Kick the can – and we kick the bucket!”
When asked if he was inconsistent on whether he wanted a no-deal Brexit or not, Johnson answered: “If we make the preparations now, that we are able to make that exit, if we have to which of course would be a last resort. The best way to avoid it is to prepare for it.
“The British people for so many years have been told that they are incapable, but they will rise to it.”
Over the coming weeks, Conservative MPs will hold a series of secret ballots to whittle down the field to a final pair in the race for the new party leader, who will be put to around 160,000 party members.
The first round of voting takes place on Thursday and candidates must receive the support of 17 MPs or be eliminated.
In the second vote scheduled for 18 June, candidates must receive the support of 33 MPs to proceed.

Davidson has been leader of the Scottish Tories since 2011.
According to various media in the UK, Davidson is expected to announce her decision tomorrow.

As Johnson’s brief tour of Europe ended at a G7 meeting in Biarritz, the UK Prime Minister revealed little of how the next several weeks will play out as he re-affirmed his pledge to leave the EU by 31 October.
Johnson was inBerlinlast Wednesday, followed byParis on Thursday, to discuss Brexit and the impasse over the backstop.
In a press conference marking the end of the summit, Johnson told reporters that it was “the job of everybody in parliament” to get Brexit finished.
However, Johnson refused to address the ongoing questions over whether he would consider proroguing or suspending parliament to secure a no-deal Brexit.
Questioned on his refusal to rule out an idea first floated several weeks ago, he told reporters: “I rely on parliamentarians to do the right thing and to honour the pledge they made to the people of this country.”

Johnson and European Council President Donald Tusk had clashed over the weekend over changes to the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May.Boris Johnson saidthat in the event of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, the UK would be free from financial obligations to the EU.
Today, theEU warnedthat the UK will have to pay up – even if it does leave without a deal.
Johnson acknowledged that agreement will be “difficult” to reach. “There is substantial disagreement. And my job is to make our case,” he said.
However, despite German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s supposed “30 day”negotiation deadlinefor an alternative solution to the backstop, Johnson completes his trip from Berlin to Biarritz without revealing how the backstop will be changed or whether a hard border can be avoided in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Today, Johnson refused to answer questions on whether he would consider calling an election in the coming weeks – instead placing the responsibility firmly on the House of Commons to deliver on the 2016 referendum.
“People have just about had enough of this conversation,” he said. But Brexit can only end, he said, “when we come out of the EU on October 31″.

“And that is really what I call on all my fellow MPs to deliver. And I hope and believe that they will,” he said.
Also speaking at the G7 this afternoon was US President Donald Trump. In a wide-ranging press conference, part of which took place alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said he would be ready to meet his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani if the circumstances were “correct” amidongoing tensionsover denuclearisation.
Trump also suggested that a deal with China could be reached in the escalating trade war with Beijing.
“I’m not sure they have a choice,” he said after earlier remarks indicating there could be a thaw in the year-long dispute that has seen tariffs imposed on billions of dollars’ worth of goods by both sides.
“I don’t mean that as a threat. I don’t think they have a choice,” Trump said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-moon-landing-northern-ireland-border-4734039-Jul2019/,"THE FRONTRUNNER IN the race to become the next British Prime Minister has said that if landing on the Moon was possible, then it’s possible to find a solution to the Irish border problem that has been cited as a stumbling block to Brexit.
In his regular Telegraph column,Johnson wrotetodayabout how the technological obstacles that faced the astronauts as they tried to land in the moon 50 years ago.
In particular, he cites the computer on the Apollo spacecraft which ran on a hand-woven ‘code’ of wires and metal rings, as well as the bravery of the astronauts.
“And yet it was with the help of that computer, and with the gumption of those pilots, that the Americans were able to perform the quite incredible feat not just of landing on the moon, but of getting back in one piece.”
Johnson uses this as a basis to argue that technological solutions at the Irish border are possible, and seems to hint in favour of a deal: “We can come out of the EU on October 31, and yes, we certainly have the technology to do so.”
Technological solutions are only needed as an alternative to the backstop, which forms part of the Brexit deal. If there’s a no-deal Brexit, as Johnson has repeatedly promised to do if they can’t get a more favourable deal, customs posts will go up along the border.
To date, the Withdrawal Agreement has been voted down three times by the House of Commons. The backstop is part of that Brexit deal, which provides for “regulatory alignment” if a future EU-UK trade deal would mean that there would be different rules on the island of Ireland and would require border customs checks.
Johnson has cited the backstop as his reason for voting against the deal for the first and second time; the third time he voted in favour of passing the deal, after Theresa May offered to stand down as Prime Minister if rebel Tory MPs voted for it.

Both Johnson has consistently been opposed to the backstop, saying it’s “unacceptable”: his opponent in the leadership race Jeremy Hunthas also saidthat the backstop would need to be removed from the Withdrawal Agreement.
“The EU keep telling us the technology isn’t there – because they want us to stay inside the Customs Union. There’s a disagreement over what technology can do… I don’t think we need new technology, I think we can do it with the technology we have.”
Frank AugsteinFrank Augstein
The EU and Irish government have said that they are open to other arrangements that would avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland – but say that it isn’t technically possible to do so. Even something as subtle as cameras along the border would be made into targets for dissidents, it’s argued, as they would symbolise a border on the island.
During his time as Foreign Secretary, Johnson said that concerns about the Irish border were“pure millennium bug stuff”: “It’s so small and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly, it’s just beyond belief that we’re allowing the tail to wag the dog in this way.”
In his column today, Johnson argues: “At its core, the problem with leaving the EU is technical and logistical.
He continues:
“It is absurd that we have even allowed ourselves to be momentarily delayed by these technical issues. If they could use hand-knitted computer code to make a frictionless re-entry to Earth’s atmosphere in 1969, we can solve the problem of frictionless trade at the Northern Irish border.”
Ballots close in the Conservative leadership election this afternoon – the final result will be announced tomorrow. On Thursday, the House of Commons breaks for its summer recess, and will return on 3 September.

“The human rights of the people of Northern Ireland shouldn’t be abandoned in the face of political indecision,” Labour’s Stella Creasy says.
Creasy led the legislative push for abortion reform in Northern Ireland.
She is currently questioning Julian Smith on how abortion reform will be implemented in Northern Ireland after 21 October.
The Guardian is reporting that the Liberal Democrats are set to back revoking Article 50 – which would mean stopping the UK’s exit from the EU. You can read thepiece here.
Here’s an extract:
The Liberal Democrats are set to officially back revoking article 50 in an attempt to position themselves as the most pro-EU political party.
The move would effectively sever the chances of an alliance with Labour at a forthcoming general election.
The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, said she would support the cancellation of Brexit, and the party expected to adopt this policy and write it into its election manifesto.
“I relish the chance to take the fight to Boris Johnson in an election and I’m confident we’d make significant gains,” said Swinson, who was elected as the party’s first female leader in July.
“Whenever the election comes, our position is clear and unequivocal. A majority Liberal Democrat government would not renegotiate Brexit, we would cancel it by revoking article 50 and remaining in the European Union.”
She will take the proposal to a vote at the party’s autumn conference in Bournemouth, which starts on Saturday.
The Northern Ireland debate is now over and there is a brief debate on the restoration of parliament.
Weshouldbe getting to the motion on an early election soon.
The debate has now started and things are sounding quite similar to last week.
With Tory MPs jeering behind him, Boris Johnson is taunting Jeremy Corbyn’s decision not to back an election.
“The only fear is that we will win it,” Johnson tells MPs to roars and cheers.
It’s going to be that kind of evening.
House of CommonsHouse of Commons
“The only options he likes are dither and delay”
Johnson has so far taken aim at the Liberal Democrats, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party and even the Speaker John Bercow.

Things are getting fiery already.
Boris Johnson has said he will not ask for another extension from the EU. This sets him on a collision course with both the British parliament and – from today – the law of the land.
The tone is very very far from the more measured language Johnson was using earlier during his meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
It’s worth reminding ourselves ofwhat he said.
“I want to get a deal. Like you, I’ve looked carefully at no deal and assessed its consequences, both for our country and yours, and yes we could do it.
He also sad that a no-deal would be a “failure of state-craft”.
Just as a reminder, as of today, the governmentmust seek a three-monthextension on the Brexit deadline if there is no deal with the EU by 19 October.
Johnson has said he won’t follow the law.
Jeremy Corbyn is up now. He has labelled the government’s no-deal preparations a “sham” and said that the 2016 referendum gave the government no mandate to crash out of the EU.
“The Prime Minister is running away from scrutiny with his blather and his shouting,” Corbyn told the House of Commons to much mirth from the Tory benches.
If Johnson’s narrative is that Corbyn is avoiding an election, then the Labour leader’s plan seems to be to label the Prime Minister as avoiding parliamentary supervision.
Shoutout for Leo Varadkar from Jeremy Corbyn:
Why did the Taoiseach tell the Prime Minister only this morning that he has yet to receive realistic, legally binding and workable plans?
I wonder if Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney and co are watching proceedings this evening? It’s all certainly a change of tone from this morning.

https://www.thejournal.ie/toilet-paper-no-deal-brexit-4843139-Oct2019/,"THE UK’S TOILET paper supplies might not withstand long-term border delays or panic buying in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a manufacturer has suggested.
Essity, which manufactures the Velvet and Cushelle brands for the UK market, said it was developing “robust contingency plans” across its supply chain to cope with a no-deal Brexit, but warned that stocks were “not unlimited”.

The company manufactures tissue in the UK and said it had built stocks of raw materials and spare parts to ensure supply in the event of short-term border delays.
It is also holding stocks of finished products that are imported or exported between the UK and European Union.
The company’s comments follow Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards using a written question in Parliament to ask ministers for details on how long stocks of toilet paper will last in a no-deal scenario.
Cabinet Office minister Simon Hart said the UK Government is working to ensure the “best possible preparation” to support the flow of goods, a response Mr Edwards labelled as “farcical” given the lack of assurances.
An Essity spokeswoman said: “As far as possible, Essity is developing robust contingency plans across the whole of our supply chain to mitigate any short-term risks following a ‘no deal’ or ‘hard’ exit of the EU.
“However, stocks are not unlimited, and some will not withstand long-term border delays outlined by the Government or in the event of consumer panic buying.”
In Parliament, Edwards said in his written question: “To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office, how long supplies of toilet paper will last in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal?”
Hart replied: “The Government would prefer to leave the EU on 31 October with a deal. If this is not possible, we will have to leave with no deal.
“In the event of no deal, the Government will prioritise the flow of goods at the border while continuing to take a risk-based approach to controls and checks on goods to minimise additional friction.”
He added: “We will continue to work to make sure we have the best possible preparation to support the flow of goods.”
Edwards told the PA news agency: “This is the farcical level we have descended to – the British Government can no longer even guarantee we have the necessary supplies of toilet paper in a crash-out Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-leaked-no-deal-brexit-plan-operation-yellowhammer-4771216-Aug2019/,"LAST UPDATE|18 Aug 2019
THE UK GOVERNMENT’S secret plans for a no-deal Brexit have been leaked, and show that it expects there would be a hard border in Northern Ireland in the most likely scenario.
Documentsprepared by the Cabinet andleaked to The Sunday Timesoutline the challenges the UK would face in a no-deal Brexit. Although the Sunday Times claims that these are preparations for what would most likely happen in a no-deal, Environment Secretary Michael Govesaid todaythat this was “a worst-case scenario”.
Gove also said that “very significant steps have been taken in the last three weeks to accelerate Brexit planning”.
The plans, which were drafted under Theresa May’s government, say that current measures to avoid a hard border in Ireland would be “unsustainable” which would lead to a hard border, and in turn could spark protests and road blocks.
This is contrast with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s assertions that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided with technological solutions, or other alternatives.
Tweeting outtoday in response to comments made by Paschal Donohoe earlier in the week, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said that “Ireland has been respectful of UK decision to leave EU from the start, but has always been clear that border infrastructure on Island of Ireland must be avoided”.
The plans also predict that Northern Ireland would face “significant” energy price rises in the event of a no-deal Brexit. There’s an all-island electricity system in place since the Good Friday Agreement, which would have to be split post-Brexit.
Meanwhile, a poll published in the Sunday Times indicates that 3 out of 5 people in Northern Ireland would back custom checks along the Irish Sea to avoid a no-deal.

The UK’s no-deal Brexit plans, called Operation Yellowhammer, also predict shortages of food, fuel and medicines; if there are difficulties importing preservatives and packaging, this would also impact on food supplies.
There’s also a potential for fresh water shortages due to possible interruptions of imported water treatment chemicals.
Price hikes would also be likely for food and electricity, and the Cabinet plans note that this that could affect “vulnerable groups”.
IT expects that 85% of trucks using the Channel crossings “may not be ready” for no-deal customs checks at the border with France, and that this will mean serious delays.

Significant disruptions at UK ports could last up to three months, before traffic “improves” to 50%-70% of its current frictionless speed.
The document says that for Gibraltar, there will be problems in transporting food, medicines, and waste across its border with the EU. But this afternoon, HM Government of Gibraltar’s chief minister Fabian Picardo said that the document wasout of date.
“We do not want a no-deal Brexit. We think it is bad for Gibraltar. We are, nonetheless, now ready for it. The matters raised in the outdated Yellowhammer leak have already been responsibly addressed in detail.”
The plans also say that the date for departure, 31 October is not “to our advantage”, as the 1 November falls on a Friday. Previous Brexit dates, 29 March and 12 April, fell on Fridays meaning that the British government had a cushion to prepare.

Many of these predictions and preparations have been aired before by experts and academics, but this is the first acknowledgement of which ones the UK government sees as realistic and worth preparing for.
It’s been common for Brexiteers to decry many of the predictions for a no-deal Brexit – which the UK government itself is preparing for according to these documents – as scaremongering and ‘Project Fear’.
Reaction
Responding to the report in the Sunday Times today, Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin said that the proposal from the UK’s Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for acaretaker governmentto push the Brexit deadline back and hold a general election “is the most realistic means of avoiding the chaos that is outlined today”.
“There is an urgent need for an alternative path to come from the House of Commons.”
He said that the plans showed “the recklessness of the current strategy being pursued by the British government that will put a hard border on our island”.
Sinn Féin’s leader in the North Michelle O’Neill said that the reports came as no surprise.
“The island of Ireland faces its biggest and most profound challenges in a generation as the threat of a no deal Brexit becomes a growing reality in the immediate time ahead.”
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that the leaked plans confirmed that Johnson doesn’t care about “the complexities and fragilities of relationships in Ireland”.
“This British government, far from sending a clear message to Brussels, is sending a clear message to people and businesses in Northern Ireland – they are willing to sacrifice our economic, political and social wellbeing to please rabid nativists in their own ranks.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-border-2-4709362-Jul2019/,"TECHNOLOGY ALONE WON’T solve the Northern Ireland border problem, according to the British government official who was in charge of Brexit border preparations until just days ago.
Karen Wheeler, who left her job as the UK customs agency’s border co-ordinator last week, also said this morning that it was “very unclear” what the Irish government was going to do about the border if there is no deal by 31 October.
Wheeler told a London audience that the British government’s main concern on land border arrangements were “the large number of small businesses that trade across the land border”, admitting that it had only “relatively late in the day” begun to discuss no-deal arrangements with them.
Cross-border trade is expected to be badly hit by a no-deal Brexit, which would mean automatic tariffs and checks for compliance with EU single market regulations.
British politicians have suggested that inspections could be done remotely. But Wheeler insisted that “technology alone is not going to solve that border problem”, adding that “in any case the technology is not in place any time soon”.
That contradicts the claims of the two Conservative leadership candidates, Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson.Hunt said yesterday in Belfastthat a border in Northern Ireland could be avoided “with the technology we have”.
Wheeler was making her first public appearance since leaving her job at HMRC, the UK tax and customs agency, last week.
She had been Director General for Borders, in charge of co-ordinating the country’s border preparations for Brexit.

Exporting
Speaking at the Institute for Government think tank today, Wheeler said that companies exporting from Northern Ireland into the Republic faced going out of business because of EU tariffs that would automatically spring up in the event of no deal.
By contrast, the UK government has said that it will waive tariffs and customs checks on the land border as part of a “strictly temporary” plan to avoid an instant hard border if the UK crashes out with no deal.
Wheeler said that, as a result, “trade would be able to come from Ireland into Northern Ireland but there would be more barriers to trade moving from Northern Ireland to Ireland… that would have economic consequences”.

Wheeler also said that while European ports, including Dublin, had made customs preparations for no-deal, it was “very unclear” how the Irish government would deal with the land border.
“Without knowing what the arrangements are on the other side of the border, it’s extremely difficult for traders to prepare,” she said.
The government has said that many customs and regulations checks could be done remotely, but not all. A report published by the NI Department for the Economy last month concluded that inspection posts would be needed for food imports, while Leo Varadkar has admitted that “animal checks are much more difficult”.
Also at the event, Cambridge law professor Lorand Bartels was asked about the idea — mentioned by Johnson yesterday – of turning Belfast into a “free port” where imports could be landed without paying tariffs.
“The main problem is that it’s extremely complicated, and you need to wall off your free trade zone from a non-free trade part of your territory”, Bartels said.
A no-deal Brexit on 31 October is seen as increasingly likely in the UK, with both Hunt and Boris refusing to rule it out.

https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-border-brexit-4856353-Oct2019/,"‘EURO = POUND’ SAY numerous signs for fireworks on the way into Newry in Co Down just five miles from the Irish border.
The shopping centre in Newry in Northern Ireland is popular with cross border shoppers taking advantage of the weaker pound. At one stage in 2008 when the pound was at its weakest, the Sainsbury’s there sold more alcohol than any other Sainsbury’s in the world.
Yesterday, a new Brexit deal was reached between EU and UK negotiators that would avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the Brexit deal reached protects the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland and avoids a hard border. However, the DUP have said they could not support the proposals.
While yesterday’s deal has been hailed as a breakthrough, residents living in frontier towns along the border have greeted the news with a cautious welcome.
Shop assistant Johny Foster who works in the Costcutter on the Dublin road on the way into Newry says the decline of the pound amid ongoing Brexit uncertainty means business is brisk with shoppers from the south of Ireland calling into the shop on their way through.
Johny says he no longer pays much heed to the radio station in the shop playing headlines on the latest twists and turns in Brexit but his ears perked up again this morning.
“It sounds pretty hopeful though and we hope this ties it up for once and for all so we can have clarity but given the fact you have the DUP saying they’re not happy with it so I don’t know what to make of if it yet,” he says.
“Brexit hasn’t really affected us much yet and we’re lucky to have a stream of southern customers and the usual surge coming up to Christmas time for the cheaper drink,” he said.
Asked if he fears talk of border checks returning he is emphatic. “Oh definitely. I was never old enough to remember the worst of the Troubles because I was a baby. When I lived in Moira, the police station was attacked but that would be my only strong memory of the violence,” he said.

In 1998, an explosive device cause extensive damage to Moira police station in Co Down and a number of civilians were injured in the incident.
“Me and my friends would feel lucky to not have lived through the worst of it so when we hear talk of a border and potential attacks or a return to violence – I just don’t want to contemplate it,” he said.
’Brexit fatigue’
Down the road in nearby Supervalu, shop manager Michael Downey said he grew up right on the border between Co Down and Co Louth.
“I have shops on both sides of the border so I’m very interested in the events playing out with Brexit and we need a clear decision to be made either way,” he said.
“Certain political parties and ones saying no to everything are going to have to give everybody else a wee bit of space here because the rest of us have to live,” he says.
“Parties need to be thinking 20 years ahead not just the next election round the corner. Get the deal done,” he said.
“We lived through the Troubles and are delighted to see them over and definitely don’t want to see them back. All that craic of army checkpoints and having your car stopped… it was torture,” he said.
“People just want to get on with their lives but at the same time, I want to see lasting peace in Northern Ireland. There was a well-supported protest up here last night where people stood on either side of the border and that tells you the level of feeling there is here against any kind of a hard border,” he said.
Supervalu owner Michael Downey
Michael says at this point, he and other people living in Northern Ireland have grown tired of political quarrels and tribal differences.
“Let us all live together, who cares where you go on a Sunday. Get on with life,” he said.

Over the border in the Irish republic in Omeath, Co Louth residents are reluctant to give their names or comment.
A publican in one of the local bars says people living in the town have “Brexit fatigue.”
“I don’t really understand much of the detail of what was announced this morning but I’m crossing that border up to ten times a day so if there’s any talk of checks or customs I will leave this area,” he said.
“I’ve been here since the early 2000s and have made a life and business here but all people are sick of all the talk and we just want to know on a practical level what it will mean for us because we’re three years waiting on it,” he said.
A local woman who was walking her dogs along the scenic Carlingford Lough said she believed the news of a deal was good but if it is not supported by everyone then it is “too soon to celebrate.”
Local Fianna Fail councillor who represents people living in Omeath and north Louth Erin McGreehan said: “Today’s deal has of course been very welcome; however I haven’t been able to have a sigh of relief just yet.”
The leader of Fianna Fail, Ireland’s main opposition party Micheal Martin said on Thursday the proposed Brexit deal the “best of both worlds” for Northern Ireland but that some concerns remain for small businesses and exports.
“There is an incredible amount of work to do in Westminster. Remember we have been here before, where the EU leaders approved a Withdrawal Treaty, a British Prime Minister approved it, even the UK Cabinet approved it and we all know the rest of that story. I am cautiously optimistic, but it is a real test is yet to come,” she said.
She also warned of potential new costs and paperwork for businesses in the Republic of Ireland as a result of the proposed deal.
“Brexit of any sort is not good news for this border region. We may have escaped the worst case scenario but there will be difficulties for people,” she concluded.","8.14am, 18 Oct 2019",
https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-brexit-political-miscalculation-4678372-Jun2019/,"TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said it is a “terrible political miscalculation” that some people in London think that because the House of Commons failed to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement that it automatically means they will get a better deal.
Speaking today, Varadkar said that he is a “little concerned about political developments in London at present”.
“Theresa May was not a bad negotiator. She had a good team. I believe they got the best deal they could have got, given the limited leverage that a country leaving the EU has,” Varadkar said.
“It took two years to negotiate the withdrawal agreement.  It is not perfect.  It is a finely balanced compromise.  Everyone had to give and take.  Sadly, the House of Commons failed to ratify that agreement.”
Varadkar made his comments after a number of candidates fighting to become Britain’s next Prime Minister have said they would be prepared to leave the EU with no deal on 31 October.
May took office after the 2016 referendum vote to leave the EU and has spent the past three years working on a departure plan, delaying Brexit twice to try to get the deal through.
However, she finally acknowledged defeat in a tearful resignation speech last month, making way for the race for a new leader.
The leadership contest kicked off yesterday as 10 Conservative MPs received enough support to take part in the party’s leadership contest.
In his comments today, Varadkar criticised the UK’s thoughts on Ireland following its decision to leave the EU.
“After the UK decided to leave the EU, they initially thought that Ireland would somehow fall into line and leave too. We did not leave and we are not leaving,” Varadkar said.
Varadkar said he hopes they are not now “making a further political miscalculation, which is to think that the House of Commons, having failed to ratify the deal, will somehow get a better deal”.
“That is to really misunderstand how the European Union works.”
Tory race
Separately, Rory Stewart today questioned fellow Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson’s ability to be prime minister.
“Is this the person that you want writing the instructions to the nuclear submarines?” Stewart said as he launched his campaign in a circus tent in London.

“Is this the man you want embodying your nation on the world stage and guiding you through the most difficult choice that Britain has faced for 50 years. I trust the Conservative members to arrive at the correct answer,” he said.

Sky Newsreported that Stewart accused his rivals of offering “fairy stories” on Brexit.
At his own campaign launch, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also lambasted Johnson, presenting himself as a “serious leader” for “serious times”.
Hunt opposed Brexit in the 2016 EU referendum but said that the Conservatives – under pressure from populist eurosceptic Nigel Farage’s new party – must deliver on the result or face “annihilation” in the next election.
Asked about “no deal”, Hunt said: “I would be prepared to without a deal if there was a straight choice between no deal and no Brexit, but I’d do so with a heavy heart.”

He claimed at the weekend that he had received encouraging signals for renegotiating the Brexit deal from German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
In response, a German government spokeswoman referenced a previous remark by Merkel that the deal cannot be reopened, although a declaration on future ties could be.
Former Brexit minister Dominic Raab meanwhile warned that Britain’s EU exit would not happen with “bluff and bluster”.
“I’m the conviction Brexiteer with the plan, the discipline and the focus to lead us out by the end of October,” he said, while also attacking Johnson’s plans for a tax cut for the rich.
Sky Newsreported today that Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who is also contesting the race, said “if we got to the end of October and the choice was between no deal and no Brexit, I would pick no deal”.
Conservative MPs will hold a series of secret ballots to whittle down the field to a final pair, who will be put to around 160,000 party members.
The first round of voting takes place on Thursday and candidates must receive the support of 17 MPs or be eliminated.
In the second vote scheduled for 18 June, candidates must receive the support of 33 MPs to proceed.

https://www.thejournal.ie/amber-rudd-quits-conservative-party-4800428-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|8 Sep 2019
BRITISH MP AND cabinet minister Amber Rudd has resigned from the Conservative party in response to Boris Johnson’s handling of Brexit.
Rudd was appointed as work and pensions secretary by former prime minister Theresa May last year and was reappointed when Johnson took over the premiership in July.
In aletter to Johnsonyesterday, Rudd resigned from her cabinet position as well as her membership of the Conservative party, citing a lack of “reassurances” from the Government, and follows a string of people to leave the party in recent days.
“This has been a difficult decision. I joined your Cabinet in good faith; accepting that ‘no deal’ had to be on the table because it was the means by which we would have the best chance of achieving a new deal to leave on 31 October,” she said.
“However, I no longer believe leaving with a deal is the government’s main objective.
“The government is expending a lot of energy to prepare for ‘no deal’ but I have not see the same level of intensity go into our talks with the European Union who have asked us to present alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop.”
Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show today, Rudd accused Johnson’s government of not doing enough to secure a new deal with the EU.
“There is no evidence of the deal. There is no formal negotiation taking place. There are just a lot of conversations,” Rudd said, adding that too much effort is going into no-deal preparations.
Johnson moved quickly to replace Rudd, appointing MP for Suffolk Theresa Coffey as work and pensions secretary.

Johnson is adamant that he needs the no-deal threat to wrest a better agreement from Brussels at a leadership summit on 17-18 October.
He is instead seeking to hold an early general election on 15 October that could give him a mandate to take Britain out on time and at any cost.
But parliament has mandated Johnson to seek an extension should his approach fail by 19 October.
Lawmakers are also expected on Monday to block his call for a snap vote for a second time. This appears to leave Johnson with few other options but to resign – something two top ministers said on Sunday he would not do.

“The prime minister will not be resigning,” interior minister Sajid Javid told the BBC today.
Javid gave few specifics about what Johnson will do should parliament tell him to ask for an extension after turning down his election challenge.
“We have a plan, which is to stick to what we have been doing,” Javid said.
Winning with voters
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested that one option would be for the government to challenge parliament’s potential delay request in court.
“It will be challenged in the courts,” Raab told Sky News.
“What we are going to do with that legislation is test very carefully what it does and doesn’t require and that’s not only the lawful thing to do, I think that’s the responsible thing to do,” Raab said.
And Johnson himself said in a letter to two Sunday newspapers that his government would “simply carry on” if his election call is turned down.
“We will surmount all the obstacles in our path,” Johnson said.
According to three separate polls published today, his message still appears to be resonating with British voters.
They show Johnson’s Conservatives either holding or extending their lead over the main opposition Labour Party to around 10 percentage points.
On Thursday Johnson’s brother Jo Johnson also resigned as a minister and MP over a “conflict of family loyalty and the national interest,” while on Tuesday Philip Leeresignedas member of the Conservative party saying “it was no longer possible to serve my constituents’ and country’s best interests”.
Johnson also withdrew the whip from 21 Tory rebels who are unable to vote as members of the Conservative party on Tuesday, which Rudd said was an “assault on decency and democracy”.
Johnson is due in Dublin tomorrow for a meeting with the Taoiseach.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-brexit-leo-varadkar-jeffrey-donaldson-4681676-Jun2019/,"DUP MP JEFFREY Donaldson has accused the Irish government of “driving us all” towards a no-deal Brexit.
Speaking this evening in Dublin at an event organised by the Institute of International and European Affairs, Donaldson said that Leo Varadkar is the “first Irish Taoiseach to subcontract Northern Ireland policy to the EU”.
“Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney knew from an early stage that the border was sensitive but they viewed that not as a delicate matter where consensus was needed but rather as a bargaining chip which could be used by Brussels,” Donaldson said.
“At a time when cool heads were needed in Brussels, Leo Varadkar was photocopying articles from the Irish Times about a 1972 Provisional IRA bombing of a customs post,” he added.
Donaldson was referring to Varadkar’s use of a recent Irish Times story about a customs post bombing in 1972, which hepresented to EU leaders in Brussels in 2018.
The DUP supported Brexit and following the 2017 UK general election entered a confidence and supply agreement to support the Conservative government. However, the party has been fiercely opposed to the inclusion of a backstop in any deal agreed between the UK  and the EU.
“If we are to lay a foundation which the next generation, both north and south can build upon, then we must recognise, before it is too late, that there is a seismic problem with the backstop,” Donaldson said this evening.

This isn’t the first time Varadkar and the Irish government have been on the receiving end of DUP criticism. During the Brexit negotiations, the relationship between the Irish government and the DUP has often been testy – in January 2018 DUP MP Sammy Wilson was forced to row back on comments callingVaradkar a “nutcase”.
Donaldson didn’t mention outgoing UK prime minister Theresa May or any of the candidates currently vying to succeed her.
Boris Johnson – whosecured a comfortablelead in the first round of the Tory leadership contest today – gave a speech at the party’s conference in 2018, while Michael Gove, who placed third behind Jeremy Hunt, has been outspoken in the past about his opposition to the Good Friday Agreement.
Whoever is appointed as the next British prime minister will need to win the DUP’s support to secure a parliamentary majority.
In recent weeks, Irish politicianshave expressedconcern that a no-deal Brexit – which would see the UK leave the EU on 31 October 2019 without a deal in place – is increasingly likely following Theresa May’s resignation as Tory leader.
Donaldson called for all sides to work together to reach a “sensible and sustainable” Brexit deal. “In supporting Brexit, we did not seek to undermine the existing agreements that underpin the peace process or to create a so-called hard border on the island,” Donaldson told the Dublin audience
“I often think that some of those who make that claim are playing on the genuine fears of people who live along the border and who rely on cross border travel to go about their daily business.”
In a statement following tonight’s talk, Labour leader Brendan Howlin said the DUP “had some reflection” to do.
“Northern Ireland did not vote to leave the European Union, and pro-EU sentiment was visible in the recent European election result. No amount of DUP positioning will hide its failure to represent the will of the people of Northern Ireland,” he said.

Quoting an unnamed UK minister,The Sun reportedtoday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson favours an arrangement that would see Ireland diverge from EU rules for a temporary period to stay aligned with the UK and avoid a border.
The minister told the paper that this would be in the form of “a bilateral agreement to agree a common rule book for Britain and Ireland”.
Coveney was not directly asked about the suggestion on RTÉ’sToday with Miriam O’Callaghanbut repeatedly said that Ireland must not diverge from EU rules, even in the case of a no-deal Brexit.

In a testy interview with Miriam O’Callaghan, Coveney denied that the Irish government was refusing to be upfront about plans for a no-deal Brexit. He said it was incorrect to say Ireland has not been speaking to the UK about no-deal preparations.
“I think it’s important that you don’t paint something that’s not true, I have spoken about border infrastructure repeatedly,” he said.
“Of course we are talking to the UK, but we are also outlining the reality to them that we cannot do some kind of side-deal here on a bilateral basis,” he added.
“That doesn’t work in the context of trade and border management when virtually all of the trade issues are determined by EU regulation and law, this has to be an agreement between the UK and the EU, whether people like that uncomfortable reality or not.”

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR spoke to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson this evening.
A government spokesperson said:
“Both sides strongly reiterated their desire to reach a Brexit deal. They hope to meet in person later this week.”
Speaking at a Fine Gael fundraiser in Dublin at the weekend, Varadkar said he was seeking a meeting with Johnson this week.
He said “time is tight” for a Brexit deal to be struck ahead of a European Council summit on 17 and 18 October.
The Taoiseach said he still believed a deal could be reached.
“Time is tight. We have a European summit on the 17th of October and it’s not reasonable to expect 27 or 28 heads of Government to sign off on something that they only see the night before or a few days before,” he said, adding:
But speaking on RTÉ News at 9pm, Varadkar was less optimistic, saying that he believed it would be “very difficult” to secure a deal by next week.
“Essentially what the United Kingdom has done is repudiated the deal that we negotiated in good faith with Prime Minister May’s government over two years,” he said.
“And they’ve sort of put half of that back on the table and saying that’s a concession, and of course it isn’t really.”
‘Blame game’
The phone call this evening comes after Johnson was accused of engaging in “stupid blame game” after Downing Street claimed the EU had made a Brexit deal “impossible”.

Downing Street sources claimed German chancellor Angela Merkel had made clear that an agreement was now “overwhelmingly unlikely”.
Following a telephone call with Boris Johnson, she was said to have insisted Ireland must have a veto over Northern Ireland leaving the customs union.
The claims provoked a furious response from European Council president Donald Tusk who accused him of jeopardising the future security of the EU and the UK.
“Boris Johnson, what’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game,” he tweeted.
“At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people.
“You don’t want a deal, you don’t want an extension, you don’t want to revoke, quo vadis?”
The Prime Minister’s official spokesman confirmed that there had been a “frank exchange” of views with the German chancellor, but refused to be drawn any further on the “source” claims.
Meanwhile, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said a UK government willing to work with the EU is needed to finalise a Brexit deal.
The minister said it was “hard to disagree” with a sentiment from President of the European Council Donald Tusk on Twitter who said the UK doesn’t want a deal, an extension or to revoke the referendum.

Coveney said Tusk’s statement reflected the enormity of what is at stake.
The Spectatorreported yesterday that a Number 10 source said that “Varadkar doesn’t want to negotiate” and that the Taoiseach has “gone very cold” since the Benn Act passed last month.
“As things stand, Dublin will do nothing, hoping we offer more, then at the end of this week they may say ‘OK, let’s do a Northern Ireland only backstop with a time limit’, which is what various players have been hinting at, then we’ll say No, and that will probably be the end,” the unnamed source allegedly said in the piece.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-phone-diplomacy-4768686-Aug2019/,"Boris Johnson rides aboard a Thames Clipper during his time as London Mayor. April 2009.
THREE WEEKS HAVE passed since Boris Johnson fulfilled a long-held, long-predicted ambition to become British Prime Minister, and we’ve still not been given much information to discern what his plans are for the UK.
What we do have, for sure, is his speech outside 10 Downing Street, patches of insight from statements at various events, and dozens of phone conversations he has had with world leaders.
In one day, 6 August, the UK government press office sent out 14 emails sharing details of Johnson’s calls with various politicians, including the outgoing European Council President Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe.

In most of his calls with EU leaders, Johnson reiterated that he wants a Brexit deal, and will be “energetic in pursuit of finding a way forward”, but emphasised that to reach a deal the so-called “anti-democratic backstop” must be “abolished”.
“Any new UK Prime Minister would have a number of engagements with his peers around the world,” says Prof Federico Fabbrini Director of the DCU Brexit Institute about the flurry of global telecommunications activity.
“The Prime Minister of the UK would immediately try to strike up relationships with his peers, but what’s different here is that it took a bit of time for Boris Johnson to start doing that. He was longer than his predecessor to liaise with world leaders, because he was busy travelling throughout the UK in his first days.
The delayed phone call with the Taoiseach, which took place 10 days after Johnson took office was another “remarkable” example of this disinterest, Fabbrini says.
Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar spoke over the phonea week afterthe former assumed office; in previous years the two neighbouring countries would have spoken the day the new UK leader took office.
The Telegraphreports todaythat UK businesses will be told about opportunities that will be made available after Brexit as part of a national £138 million public information campaign.
A Whitehall source told the paper that ”one thing [businesses] can prepare for is the export opportunities” arising from the UK being able to strike its own free trade deals with non-EU countries.
The meaty part: Trade deals
Future free trade deals and other economic ties between the UK and non-EU countries will be the real marker of whether Brexit will have been worth it. So these calls with world leaders are just the start of possible future trading ties post-Brexit.
Johnson is trying to reproduce Donald Trump’s approach of not fully sustaining his current international relationships, and going it alone, Fabbrini says, but notes that the UK is not the same as the US, in terms of size, scale and influence.
During Johnson’s recent call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they agreed “to look for new ways to build” on their relationship when the UK leaves the EU, “including by stepping up trading ties”.
Johnson said something similar during his call with the Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: “The PM acknowledged the significance of Egypt as a market for British investment.”

In a call with King Hamad of Bahrain, the King spoke of the Johnson importance of trade between the UK and Gulf Cooperation Council, emphasising his ambition “to increase that trade post-Brexit”.
Interestingly, there was no mention of trade during Johnson’s phone call with theAustralian Prime MinisterScott Morrison.
In hisphone call with Japan’s premier Abe, the tone was more urgent: He said they both were committed to an “ambitious” free trade deal that would build on the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement earlier this year. The statement added:
“The Prime Minister was clear on the importance of Japanese investment in the UK, and the need to ensure a smooth transition for businesses through the UK’s exit from the EU, whatever the circumstances.
“They will have been engaging in negotiations on future trade deals,” Fabbrini says of the calls, but adds that it’s “highly unlikely that they have made progress”.

Johnson’s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has also been busy wooing countries during an Asia-Pacific tour and a quick trip to the US, Canada and Mexico during his first two weeks in office.
After visiting Canada and the United States during a tour of North America, Raab said in Mexico city that “this is just the moment” for the UK and Mexico to do more together, while the Mexican government said it was prepared to work on developing an “ambitious” trade deal with a post-Brexit UK.
Raab also secured assurances from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who agreed to sign a bilateral trade deal as soon as possible after Brexit, and John Bolton of course said that the UK would be “first in the queue” for a “great” trade deal after it leaves the EU.
But what happens when two nations that have putting themselves first as their prime focus try to negotiate a trade deal?
“The limit of the nationalist economic agenda that clashes with the global reality,” Fabbrini says, adding that the UK would have to do something that the EU was unwilling to, and lower standards for food and other products to strike up a trade deal.
Because of these limitations in trade deals that Johnson can do post-Brexit, it’s hard to see how the negative impacts of a no-deal Brexit could be negated by other trading arrangements.
A slight segue into Johnson’s intentions
Earlier this week, ina Facebook videothat Johnson’s team called ‘People’s PMQs’, Johnson was asked who his favourite political heroes were, and after the obligatory Churchill mention, he answered:
“But also Pericles of Athens, who believed in all sorts of wonderful things, he certainly believed in great infrastructure projects, and also believed in the importance of the many, not the few.
“But above all, Pericles will go down as one of the most powerful articulators of the idea of democracy, which is that the people are ultimately in charge of their own destiny.”
Without reading too much into that choice, Pericles was a Greek leader from 461 to 429 BC, and was lauded for building within the country and strengthening democratic functions within the state. More interestingly in this context, though, he halted a policy of expanding the Athenians’ territory and instead preserved the status quo, protecting what they already had, a choice that wasn’t particularly welcomed by his citizens.
One of the central motivators behind Brexit is to end the UK’s close-knit and lucrative trade deal with the European Union, in favour of more beneficial trade deals with other non-EU countries.
The UK is also hoping for a good, fair trade deal with the EU itself post-Brexit; whether that wish is fulfilled depends on whether there’s a deal or not, and how relations between Johnson and the new leading figures of the European Union progress.

SINN FÉIN LEADER Mary Lou McDonald has met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and said she warned him “to make sure he’s not the DUP’s gofer”.
“He asked for our advice [on how to restore the power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland]. We have told him he needs to make sure he’s not the DUP’s gopher, he needs to stop mollycoddling them, and to spell out the realities of life to them,” she said outside Stormont.
The DUP said that the Prime Minister assured them during their meeting that he would “never be neutral on the union”.
Johnson met with the five main political parties in Northern Ireland today, to encourage a resolution in talks between Sinn Féin and the DUP to form a Northern Ireland Assembly, which collapsed over two years and a half ago.
In a statementfollowing his meetings today, 10 Downing St said that the Prime Minister “made clear his belief and commitment in the rigorous impartiality set out in the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement, while at the same time reaffirming his determination to strengthen the Union and Northern Ireland’s place within it”.
Liam McBurneyLiam McBurney
The DUP is also supporting the Tories in government, something that Sinn Féin has argued impedes talks in Northern Ireland, as under the Good Friday Agreement the UK government and Irish government must be impartial intermediaries between the two sides.
Johnson attended a dinner with the DUP last night, something he said didn’t affect his “absolute impartiality”; but today following her meeting with the PM, McDonald said that she told him that “nobody believes that”.
He was told that the coalition with the DUP has “poisoned the groundwater here politically”, McDonald said, making it “very very very difficult to sustain a negotiation, much less to land on a conclusion”.
On Brexit, McDonald says that Johnson seemed to have “set the compass for a disorderly and a crash-out Brexit” and that he seemed “complacent about Ireland being the collateral damage of Brexit”.

This visit is part of Johnson’s tour of the UK; yesterday, Johnson met with the Welsh First Minister; on Monday he met with the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon.
The DUP
DUP leader Arlene Foster said that Boris Johnson told them that he would “never be neutral on the union”, but he will be neutral on issues related to Stormont, which Foster says she’s heard “confused quite regularly”.
She said they discussed issues with Harland and Wolff and Wrightbus, and said that they would continue to work with the Prime Minister on these areas.

Deputy leader and MP Nigel Dodds said that on the issue of the DUP hosting a dinner with Johnson the night before, that he hoped the media would question Sinn Féin on whether they will want to be part of a government in Dublin.
Dodds responded to McDonald’s comments that the DUP-Tory arrangement in Westminster had “poisoned the groundwater” at Stormont, by saying that people in Northern Ireland who have benefitted in healthcare, schools, and broadband access from the £1 billion in funds given to Northern Ireland as a result, would disagree.
Dodds also welcomed Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith, who he said would bring “a focus on detail” to negotiations in the time ahead.
Johnson left Stormont earlier this afternoon, immediately after his meetings.
Earlier: ‘Playing chicken’
In a brief interview with Sky News on his way to the talks with Sinn Féin, Johnson said his focus is getting the Northern Ireland Executive back up and running.
“The people in Northern Ireland have been without a government, without Stormont, for two years and six months. My prime focus this morning is to do everything I can to help that get that up and running again.
Johnson said Brexit “may come up a little bit, I don’t rule that out”.

“I think the crucial thing to stress is that I obviously attach huge importance to the letter, the spirit, of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and will be insisting on that.”

Earlier, Sinn Féin’s leader in the Northern Ireland Assembly Michelle O’Neill accused Johnson of “playing chicken with the EU”, something  she said is “not going to work”.
Speaking on RTÉ’sMorning Ireland, O’Neill said Johnson was “clearly electioneering”.
“All his bluster and rhetoric and bullish language of the last week doesn’t serve anybody well, it actually strikes fear into the heart of the economy here,” she said.
O’Neill earlier said she plans to “make clear to him the people here voted to remain and there isn’t anything to good to come from Brexit”.

She stated that a no-deal Brexit could have devastating effects on the economy in both Northern Ireland and the Republic, as well as putting the peace process in the North in jeopardy.
O’Neill said Britain crashing out of the EU would amount to “putting the Good Friday Agreement into the bin”, adding: “We cannot go there.”
She noted that Johnson’s Conservative Party depends on the DUP for political survival, saying “that itself is causing huge problems”.
Liam McBurneyLiam McBurney
She said the fact Johnson had dinner with members of the DUP prior to meeting other parties today “doesn’t put him off to the best start”.
‘Significant prospect of no deal’
In an interview with BBC Radio 4 Today this morning, DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said: “The prospect of a no-deal Brexit is significant”, adding that such a scenario is “not good in the short term for the economy in Northern Ireland”.
Speaking on Morning Ireland, DUP leader Arlene Foster said she was not concerned that Johnson would call an election and sideline her party, adding: “We want to find a way forward.”
Foster, who campaigned in favour of Brexit, said “nobody wants a no-deal situation” but that governments must prepare for such a scenario.
She said estimates that Brexit could put 40,000 jobs in the North at risk, as put forward by Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, are “hyperbole”.

‘Belligerence and intolerance’
Many Conservative and DUP politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
Foster again stressed her opposition to the backstop today, accusing the Irish government of treating the North with “belligerence and intolerance”.
Irish and European leaders have repeatedly said that the deal cannot be renegotiated.
In his first speech as prime minister last week, Johnson pledged to leave the EU by the current deadline of 31 October.
“The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts,” he said.
“The doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters are going to get it wrong again … We are going to come out of the EU on October 31 – no ifs, no buts. We will do a new deal, a better deal that will maximise the opportunities.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/tusk-welcomes-promising-signals-as-barclay-meets-barnier-for-brexit-talks-4847180-Oct2019/,"LAST UPDATE|11 Oct 2019
THE EU’S BREXIT negotiator Michel Barnier has secured the approval from the leaders of the EU’s 27 member states to return to intensive Brexit negotiations, according to diplomats.
Barnier’s meeting with ambassadors was still going on, but officials with knowledge of the talks said that the 27 other EU countries had responded positively.
“Yes, confirmed,” one diplomat told AFP.
A statementpublished by the European Commission confirmed that the EU and the UK have agreed to “intensify discussions” over the coming days – but wasn’t clear on whether they would enter“tunnel”negotiations.
It added: “The Commission will take stock with the European Parliament and Member States again on Monday in view of preparing the General Affairs Council (Article 50) on Tuesday morning.”
Breakfast in Brussels
Earlier, Barnier met with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay for two-hours in Brussels, as chances of a breakthrough appeared to rise after face-to-face talks between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
European Council President Donald Tusk had welcomed “promising signals” from Varadkar that a new deal may be possible, but warned that the UK has still not presented “a workable, realistic proposal”.
Yesterday, Varadkar and Johnson released a joint statement saying they could “see a pathway” to a possible agreement.
Barclay’s talks were viewed as the last chance to get a breakthrough on a Brexit deal ahead of a meeting of the European Council next Thursday and Friday, with the next Brexit deadline just three weeks away.
As the meeting got under way, Tusk tweeted: “The UK has still not come forward with a workable, realistic proposal. But I have received promising signals from Taoiseach@LeoVaradkar that a deal is possible.
The start of intense negotiations is expected to begin this weekend, ahead of the crunch EU heads of government summit on 17 and 18 October.

The unexpectedly cordial atmosphere of the meeting between Varadkar and Johnson led to speculation of a possible compromise on the contentious issue of the Northern Ireland border backstop.
Sterling rose sharply on international money markets in the wake of the talks.
Earlier
Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said that the Cabinet had been briefed on the meeting, but would not explain what concessions may have prompted the surprise optimism.
“It does not benefit anyone to have a running commentary on live negotiations,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
After more than two hours of “detailed and constructive” discussions at a country manor on the Wirral yesterday, the two leaders said it was in “everybody’s interest” to get an agreement which would allow the UK to leave with a deal.
Varadkar said he hoped the progress they had made would be “sufficient” to enable intensive negotiations to resume in Brussels ahead of next week’s crucial EU summit.
The Taoiseach said: “I think it is possible for us to come to an agreement, to have a treaty to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly fashion, and to have that done by the end of October, but there’s many a slip between cup and lip,” he said.
Varadkar refused to be drawn on any “concessions” made by either side, while UK Government sources refused to be drawn on Irish press reports suggesting “significant movement” by the UK.
Tory former chancellor and arch-Brexiteer Lord Norman Lamont said he wanted to know what any UK concessions were. He told the BBC: “No, I am not worried. I have to know what the concessions are.
He added: “Maybe there is some change on the mechanism whereby the deal is approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.
“Maybe there will be an opting-out mechanism rather than an opting-in mechanism.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-court-case-4672377-Jun2019/,"
BRITAIN’S HIGH COURT has thrown out a misconduct in public office case against Boris Johnson.
Johnson had challenged the lawsuit which accused him of knowingly lying during the Brexit referendum campaign.
Lawyers for the Tory MP, who leads a crowded field of contenders vying to be Conservative Party leader after Theresa May formally resigns today, had claimed in court that the private prosecution was “politically motivated and vexatious”.
The case, brought by businessman Marcus Ball in a crowd-funded initiative, concerns Johnson’s claim that Britain sends £350 million (€400 million) a week to the European Union.

While this was Britain’s gross contribution, the net figure accounts for a budget rebate from the EU as well as payments to Britain’s public sector from the EU budget, and is substantially less.
The official Leave campaign emblazoned the controversial figure on the side of its touring bus during the 2016 EU referendum, while Johnson and other Brexiteers repeatedly trumpeted it campaigning.
Ball, 29, crowdfunded more than £300,000 through an online campaign to bring the case, alleging misconduct in public office.
In a written decision on May 29, district judge Margot Coleman agreed, ruling she was satisfied there was a proper case to issue a summons — prompting today’s legal challenge.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER claimed in parliament that the best way to “honour the memory” of murdered MP Jo Cox would be “to get Brexit done”.
Johnson made the extraordinary claim this evening as a number of opposition MPs implored him to moderate his language so as not to ‘whip up’ threats and intimidation against members.
Labour MP Cox was murdered by afar-right extremist a week before the Brexit vote in 2016. She had been a remain supporter.
In the House of Commons this evening, Johnson used the terms ‘Surrender Act’ and ‘Capitulation Act’ when referring to the Benn Act, which seeks to force the government to seek a Brexit extension to avoid a no-deal.

Shameful from@BorisJohnsonto continue calling the Benn Bill the Surrender Bill whipping up local tensions increasing threats and intimidation to MPs across the house. He just doesn’t care because it’s all about him.
Tracy Brabin, who succeeded Cox in her former constituency asked Johnson to be more careful in his use of language.
“As the woman who has taken over a seat that was left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him, in all honesty, as a human being, please, please. Will he, going forward, moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when we’re going about our jobs?”

In response, Johnson said that the act he refers to “greatly enfeebles the government’s ability to negotiate”.
“What I will say is that the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done,” he added.
TheJournal.ie/ YouTube
Earlier Johnson was asked by another MP, Paula Sherriff, to refrain from using language which painted MPs “as traitors”.
“We must moderate our language and it has to come from the Prime Minister first, so I would be interested in hearing his opinion. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself,” Sheriff added.
Johnson responded: “I think Mr Speaker, I have to say Mr Speaker I have never heard such humbug in my life.”
Johnson’s comments with respect to Cox have sparked anger from several opposition politicians.
Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said Johnson was an “utter disgrace” while SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said Johnson “is not fit to speak her name”.
In response to the use of his wife’s name during the raucous debate, Jo Cox’s husband Brendan Cox called for more civility.
“Feel a bit sick at Jo’s name being used in this way. The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common,” he tweeted.
“Just to reiterate this is about the role we all play. Just as ‘surrender’ & ‘betrayal’ is inflammatory language, so is ‘coup’ and ‘fascist’. Let’s all play our part in dialing it down.”

It will be their first meeting since Javid was appointed to the role.

However, he warned that Brexit “poses a serious challenge for all of us”.
“A no-deal Brexit is in no-one’s interests.  Along with our partners in the EU27, we remain firmly of the view that the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and fully protect the Good Friday Agreement is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement,” he said.

UK MPS HAVEvotedto debate a bill that, if passed, would extend the current Brexit deadline to 31 January 2020 at the earliest.
Boris Johnson’s first Commons defeat as Prime Minister in which 21 “rebel” Tory MPs voted against him raises a number of questions as to likely next steps on the long and winding Brexit road.
So, what’s next?
MPs now have the chance to pass all stages of Labour MP Hilary Benn’s bill as last night’s motion means the debate on Benn’s bill has to happen before 5pm this Friday. It is  thought it will be voted on today and then go to the House of Lords tomorrow.
The bill is designed to extend Article 50 and prevent the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. It would push the current Brexit deadline of 31 October to 31 January next year at the earliest and put a ban on a no-deal Brexit on the statute books.
‘Dither, delay, confusion’
After last night’s debate, however, Johnson – who has consistently said the UK is leaving the EU by 31 October “do or die” – said he plans to bring forward a motion for an early general election.
Advertisement
A senior government official told the BBC earlier yesterday that a motion for an election would be put forward if MPs take the first steps towards passing legislation to block no deal this week – which they now have.
Boris Johnson is confident he would win the required two-thirds majority for his motion to be passed, the official added. He has yet to table that motion, however.
Following last night’s vote, Johnson said the move by MPs to further Benn’s bill would “hand control” of Brexit negotiations to the EU and bring “more dither, more delay, more confusion”.
He also told MPs that he’d no choice but to press ahead with efforts to call an election, saying: “The people of this country will have to choose.”
An election must be held 25 days after a no-confidence vote or the dissolution of parliament; meaning if it were prompted this week, 17 October is the most likely date for polling day, as it’s the first available Thursday, which is the weekday UK elections are usually held.
Today MPs will gather back in the House of Commons to debate Benn’s bill. The debate on the bill will likely take place in parliament at 7pm, with a vote at 10pm.
But first, Prime Minister’s Questions take place from 12pm so we’ll know more then. Johnson could call a general election in attempt to gain the upper hand and enshrine his authority as PM.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said, however, that Benn’s bill should be passed before any election is held.
The game goes on…

https://www.thejournal.ie/micheal-martin-brexit-plans-4798706-Sep2019/,"FIANNA FÁIL LEADER Micheál Martin has called on the government to publish all of its no-deal preparations.
Cabinet ministers were this week briefed by Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney on the predicted impact of a no-deal Brexit on Ireland’s economy.
The Irish Times reported ministers were told some 10,000 jobs in the tourism and hospitality sector would likely be lost in the first three months after a no-deal Brexit situation.
They were also reportedly told border checks would have to take place, with a mention of mobile checks, but the government is currently deciding how much detail to release to the public about this.
“I think we all have the right to be concerned about briefings which emerged from this week’s cabinet meeting about the impact of a no-deal Brexit,” Martin said in a speech to the Kennedy Summer School in New Ross today.
“According to senior sources quoted in the media, ministers were shocked by what they heard, arrangements are being finalised for checks which in the past we were told wouldn’t happen and it was decided to withhold the briefing from the public,” he said.

Martin said Ireland “dodged a bullet” earlier this year but cannot afford “the same failings” again.
“I think it is long past time for the government to publish everything it has about no deal preparations. Let’s see the full details. Without the spin and with the full costs and administrative arrangements outlined,” Martin said.
“Our government has to end the policy of hoping that something will turn up to stop it all happening – and a full openness and transparency about what will have to be done is long past due.”
He said Ireland needs to reject the idea that asking hard questions is “risking our national consensus of remaining true to the European ideal”.
“In fact, the biggest threat to our consensus on Europe is an approach which is intolerant of debate and which treats the public as if it cannot be trusted with hard facts.”
Speaking toRTÉ’s Sean O’Rourketoday, Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee said the government is working with the European Commission to determine how border controls and checks would work.
She said it is hoped most of these checks could take place away from the border in businesses, at ports or at airports.
McEntee said the government wants to let people know as soon as possible where checks will be.

https://www.thejournal.ie/gove-brexit-northern-ireland-warrenpoint-border-4760108-Aug2019/,"MICHAEL GOVE HAS said that the UK government will work to “safeguard” security on the island of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Gove, who has been charged by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson with no-deal planning, visited Middletown and Warrenpoint, as well as the border, during a visit to Northern Ireland today.
Speaking to reporters at Warrenpoint Port, he said in the event of a no-deal Brexit “we will make sure that we safeguard the security of people on the island of Ireland, but also make sure that trade continues to flow as freely as possible”.

Fears have grown since Johnson’s election as Tory leader that the UK is set to crash out of the EU on 31 October.
Gove said that his visit was part of ensuring that “commerce can flow, that investment can be secure for the future and that jobs and prosperity can be safeguarded” if the UK does leave without a deal.
Tensions between Ireland and the UKhave grownin recent weeks as both the EU and the British government refuse to compromise on the Irish backstop, which has provoked major opposition from Brexiteers.
Gove said he thought that UK and Ireland had “very good” bilateral relations.
Northern Ireland is set to be worst affected by Brexit, whether the UK secures a deal or not.

https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-resettlement-uk-brexit-4786991-Sep2019/,"THE HOME OFFICE has denied claims that the deadline for EU citizens who live in the UK to apply to remain there post-Brexit has changed.
Britain is due to leave the European Union on 31 October, with or without a deal.
Concerns have been raised in recent days about the impact a no-deal scenario could have on the future status of European citizens living in the UK.
Through theEU Settlement Scheme, EU, EEA (EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and Swiss citizens can apply to remain in the UK after Brexit. People who were born in the UK but are not a British citizen can also apply.
Irish citizens, individuals with ‘indefinite leave to remain’ status, and people who are exempt from immigration control such as foreign diplomats, do not need to apply.
More than one million of the 3.5 million EU citizens living in the UK have applied to the scheme to date and been granted settled or pre-settled status. This means their rights are secured under UK law.
The deadline to apply is 30 June 2021, or 31 December 2020 if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the British government has said.
The scheme made headlines during the week after a government ad wasbanned from the airwavesbecause the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority ruled that it was “misleading”.
The radio ad stated in April that in order to apply to the scheme people just required a passport or an ID card.
As part of the application process, people need to prove their identity and address, show how long they have lived in the UK, and declare any criminal convictions.
‘Legal limbo’
Meanwhile, some people seeking information about the scheme say they have been given conflicting information about deadlines and their right-to-work post-Brexit.
A spokesperson for the Home Office toldTheJournal.iethe above deadlines remain in effect.
Nora Mulready, a former Change UK MEP candidate for London, said she was recently told by the EU Settlement Scheme office that the rights of EU citizens who had not applied to the scheme before 31 October “could not be guaranteed” from 1 November onwards.
Home Secretary Priti Patel earlier this month said thatfreedom of movementbetween the UK and the EU will end overnight on 31 October, despite previous plans for a transition period, in the event of a no-deal scenario.

Mulready said she was told all EU citizens should aim to apply to the scheme by 31 October as, if freedom of movement is ended, “they’ll find themselves in difficulty”.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
Mulready said she was also told that if an EU citizen is out of the country if and when a no-deal scenario happens, “it will not be easy for them to come back into Britain”.
When asked about these claims, a Home Office spokesperson said “some inaccurate reporting has suggested that, once freedom of movement ends after Brexit, EU citizens resident in the UK will be left in ‘legal limbo’”.
“EU citizens and their families are welcome to stay and there are no changes to the deadline to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme,” a statement noted.
The spokesperson said an EU citizen who already lives in the UK but is abroad if and when free movement ends, “would still be eligible for the EU Settlement Scheme” (as would their family).
They encouraged EU citizens and their families to apply to the scheme as soon as possible, but added: “For those who haven’t applied when free movement ends, they will still have the same entitlements to work, benefits and services and will be able to prove these in the same way as they do now.”
Employment rights
In terms of employment rights, the spokesperson said:
“Employers should continue to conduct right-to-work checks in the same way as they do now in compliance with the current statutory codes of practice,” they added, referencing the December 2020 deadline to apply to the scheme.
The spokesperson said arrangements for EU citizens and their families who arrive in the UK after free movement ends will be outlined by the Home Office soon.
Of the one million-plus people who have been granted status through the resettlement scheme by 31 July, two-thirds received settled status, generally as they had been resident in the UK for five years or more, with one-third being granted pre-settled status.
Up to the end of last month, 958,000 applications had been received from England, 51,600 from Scotland, 15,600 from Wales and 12,900 from Northern Ireland.
Pre-settled status is granted to people who confirm that they been in the country for less than five years. This aligns with EU law whereby someone receives permanent residence status after five years.
Once EU citizens and their families have five years’ residence in Britain, they can apply for settled status, which grants them leave on an indefinite basis.
“Nobody has been granted pre-settled status without first being offered, and declining, the opportunity to submit evidence that they qualify for settled status,” the Home Office spokesperson said.
They added that, up to at least the end of June, no one who applied for status had been refused.

https://www.thejournal.ie/border-backstop-report-4694953-Jun2019/,"A UK REPORT looking into potential alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border in Ireland has recommended that a working arrangement “should be fully up and running within three years”.
The report is by the Alternative Arrangements Commission, a group which is backed by two Remain-supporting MPs Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands.
The report noted that the Brady amendment to the Withdrawal Agreement which sought to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements passed the House of Commons in January.

In looking at the potential for alternative arrangements to be found, the report states that “new technology has a role to support policy” but that methods used at the beginning of the process “should already be in use elsewhere”.
To ensure that standards are maintained in the area food and agricultural produce, the report recommends that checks be carried out “by mobile units away from the border”.
This would potentially mean checks at farms or at food production facilities.
Writingtoday in The Times, Morgan and Hands said it is “ludicrous” to suggest that an alternative arrangement is “some sort of high-tech unicorn”.
“While we should always be open to innovation, these solutions can be implemented within three years, with some measures introduced much sooner, subject to political agreement, ensuring the backstop is not triggered, or if it is, there is a clear route map out of it,” they say.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said he would not resign to avoid having to delay Brexit beyond the end of October.
Johnson has continually vowed to take Britain out of the EU by 31 October, despite parliament passing the Benn Act which requires him to ask for an extension to the Brexit deadline if MPs fail to approve a deal.
Speaking on BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show this morning, Johnson, who has previously said he’d rather be “dead in a ditch” than request a delay, said:
“No, I have undertaken to lead the party and my country at a difficult time and I am going to continue to do that. I believe it is my responsibility to do that.”
Johnson this morning also defended his use of language in Parliament and denied any wrongdoing in relation to his links with American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri.
Earlier this week, the Prime Minister was criticised in Parliament for saying that the best way to “honour the memory” of murdered MP Jo Cox would be “to get Brexit done”.
Johnson made the claim after a number of opposition MPs implored him to moderate his language so as not to ‘whip up’ threats and intimidation against members.
Labour MP Cox was murdered by afar-right extremist a week before the Brexit vote in 2016. She had been a remain supporter.
Johnson also used the terms ‘Surrender Act’ and ‘Capitulation Act’ when referring to the Benn Act, which seeks to force the government to seek a Brexit extension to avoid a no-deal.
Speaking to the BBC ahead of the four-day Tory Party conference in Manchester today, Johnson defended his use of language.
He said: “I want to make a very important distinction between that issue of threats and abuse directed at MPs which is totally unacceptable and we have to prevent and what I think is the legitimate use of old tried and trusted metaphors to describe certain parliamentary acts or indeed events in politics.
“If you cannot use a metaphor like surrender to describe the ‘Surrender Act’ then in my view you are impoverishing the language and diminishing parliamentary debate,” he said.

In the Commons on Wednesday, Tracy Brabin, who succeeded Cox in her former constituency asked Johnson to be more careful in his use of language.

“As the woman who has taken over a seat that was left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him, in all honesty, as a human being, please, please. Will he, going forward, moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when we’re going about our jobs?”
In response, Johnson said that the act he refers to “greatly enfeebles the government’s ability to negotiate” and when taken to task on his use of language by MP Paula Sherriff, whose complaints he later dismissed as “humbug”.
Challenged by Marr on the issue, Johnson this morning said that he thought she was talking about the Benn Act and that he had committed a “total misunderstanding”.
“That was wrong, that was not my intention,” he says, adding he is “sorry for the misunderstanding”.
Meanwhile, the controversy surrounding Johnson and American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri has grown, with The Sunday Times reporting Arcuri told friends she had an affair with him while he was mayor of London.
On Friday, the Prime Minister was referred to the police complaints body to assess whether he should face a criminal investigation over his links with the former model.
The Sunday Times reported Arcuri was given £126,000 in public money and privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor.
Johnson has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to his links with Ms Arcuri.
Appearing on the BBC this morning, Johnson said of the matter: “There was no interest to declare.”
‘Credible proposal’
With Britain due to leave the EU on the 31 October, a withdrawal agreement seems increasingly unlikely.
Johnson had previously said that despite parliament passing legislation to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, he would seek to leave anyway on that date even if no agreement had been reached with the EU.
Speaking today, Johnson said he believes a deal can still be struck.
“I do think there is a good chance and we’re working incredibly hard…we’ll continue to work tomorrow and in the course of the next few days right up until October 13th to see if we can get this thing over the line,” Johnson said.
Meanwhile, Tánaiste Simon Coveney told the Sunday Independent today that Johnson’s claim that he wants a deal will be tested this week and that a “credible proposal” must be put forward “if he is serious about getting a deal”.
“If there not a serious effort on the British side to put forward a proposal that’s credible, then I think we’re into a very difficult space,” Coveney said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/labour-corbyn-no-deal-brexit-4828896-Sep2019/,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speaking during a visit to ChingfordGareth FullerGareth Fuller
LABOUR REMAINS DETERMINED to cut off the prospect of a no-deal Brexit before pressing for a general election, Jeremy Corbyn has said.
A senior SNP MP said the opposition parties could stage a vote of no-confidence in the government as early as next week in a bid to oust British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
It follows talks at Westminster by party leaders aimed at thwarting any attempt by Johnson to push through a no-deal break on 31 October against the will of Parliament.
Speaking to reporters at a rally in Chingford, Essex, Corbyn said he stood ready to lead an interim government if Johnson was forced from No 10.
However, he said his first priority was to ensure the Prime Minister complied with the so-called Benn Act which requires him to seek a further Brexit delay if he cannot get a new deal with the EU.
“Our priority, all of us, is to prevent a no-deal exit from the European Union on the 31st,” he said.
Former chancellor Philip Hammond accused the Prime Minister of failing to negotiate seriously with the EU while the speculators who backed him stood to make a killing in the event of no-deal.
“As his sister (Rachel Johnson) has reminded us, he is backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit – and there is only one outcome that works for them: a crash-out no-deal Brexit that sends the currency tumbling and inflation soaring,” he wrote in an article for The Times.
“So they, at least, will be reassured to see no evidence at all that his government has seriously pursued a deliverable deal; still less that it has been pursuing a deal that could get us out by October 31.”

No confidence vote
Meanwhile, the SNP MP Stewart Hosie said that a no-confidence vote might be the only way to stop no-deal.
“We have to do that because there is now no confidence that the Prime Minister will obey the law and seek the extension that Parliament voted for only a few weeks ago,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
“If we are serious about the extension, that is the only game in town.”
So far, opposition leaders have been wary of tabling a confidence vote, fearing Johnson could, if he is defeated, simply delay a general election until after 31 October by which time Britain will be out of the EU.
Hosie acknowledged the plan could only work if an alternative government capable of commanding a Commons majority had been “pre-agreed” before the vote.
However the Liberal Democrats, as well as rebel Tories who had the whip withdrawn, have made clear they that they are not prepared to see Corbyn enter No 10 as Prime Minister.
However, Hosie said it was “self-evidently the case” that as the leader of the second largest party Westminster, Corbyn should have the first chance of forming an administration.
“If Jo Swinson and the Lib Dems are actually serious about their stopping Brexit position then they need to stop playing political games, get on board with everybody else,” he said.
“If that is not in place and effectively pre-agreed, then we might end up having the general election on Boris Johnson’s terms, allowing him to run down the clock and crash out without a deal.”
Corbyn confirmed that in such an event, he would expect to be given the first crack at forming a government with the sole purpose of seeking a Brexit extension and then holding a general election.
“The normal process is that when a government collapses, the leader of the opposition is invited to form a minority government in order to carry through a specific and strictly limited process which would be to ensure no crash-out and to prepare for a general election,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/jeremy-corbyn-backs-remain-4717308-Jul2019/,"THE UK’S LABOUR party has conditionally backed holding another Brexit referendum in which it would support remaining in the EU.
Labour will now challenge whoever wins the Conservative Party leadership race and becomes prime minister to put any Brexit deal they strike with the EU to a referendum, “with remain on the ballot, in which Labour would campaign for remain,” the party said.
The issue has divided the party since the referendum result: many of its voters in working-class areas voted to leave the EU in the Brexit referendum of 2016. But the majority of Labour MPs strongly support remaining in the EU.
Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose held eurosceptic views for the bulk of his career, had resisted strong pressure to back another vote. But he relented after Labour-affiliated trade unions agreed yesterday to support the move.
In an interview with the BBC,Corbyn said Labour was now the “party of choice” when it came to Brexit. When asked whether he’s changed his views because of pressure from party colleagues, Corbyn said “Not a bit of it. I’ve been listening and I’ve enjoyed it.”

Fear over ‘no deal’ divorce
The party’s previous policy was to respect the 2016 referendum, but the chaotic process of leaving the EU has made citizens more cynical about their government and emboldened those hoping to stay in.
“As democrats, Labour accepted the result of the 2016 referendum,” Corbyn wrote in an email to party members.
“In our 2017 manifesto, Labour also committed to oppose a no-deal Brexit and the Tories’ Brexit plans,” he added, calling on the incoming prime minister to hold a general election.
Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May is stepping down this month after failing to get her EU divorce plan through parliament.
The two men vying to replace her, frontrunner Boris Johnson and foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, have both said they were willing to take Britain out of the EU without a deal on 31 October.
However, the majority of members of parliament – including Labour – are against a no deal option, fearing dire economic consequences that economists, trade experts, and the Chancellor Philip Hammond have warned of.
But neither Hunt nor Johnson supports the idea of a second referendum. If the political deadlock continues, many in Westminster believe a snap election is inevitable.

Irish beef farmers have been protesting in recent weeks over the threats to their livelihoods due to the drop in sterling caused by Brexit and other issues.
Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed confirmed that the grant would be available to farmers from today, which is funded by a combination of EU exceptional aid and Exchequer support, and is being provided “in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of market volatility and uncertainty arising out of Brexit”.
Creed said that “the prolonged period of depressed prices and ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outcome of Brexit, has led to a difficult period of market disturbance”.

The BEAM grant, coupled with the Beef Environmental Efficiency Pilot (BEEP), introduced earlier this year, provides an injection of up to €120m in aid for the beef sector in 2019.
BEAM is targeted towards those farmers most affected, the Department said.
It’s also designed to meet the requirements set out by the Commission, including granting support to farmers engaging in actions which “enhance their long-term resilience and sustainability”.

AUTHOR AND JOURNALIST Bonnie Greer, whose defence of Ireland on a TV debate last night drew attention and praise, has said she was “surprised” by the reaction.
Speaking on BBC Question Timelast night, Greer – who is from the US but has lived in the UK for 30 years – told the audience that “Ireland owes the UK nothing” over Brexit.
“Oftentimes, I hear people talking about Ireland as if this country owns Ireland.
“Ireland owes this country nothing. Ireland owes this country no concessions, it owes it no quarter, it owes it nothing,” Greer said.
Today, she told RTÉ Radio One’s Drivetime programme that she was “surprised” at the support she’d received following her appearance.
“I think I’ve been invited to every town and city in Ireland and I’m very grateful, it’s amazing. I don’t know what to say. I thought I said something that everybody knew,” she said.

Greer said she was stunned that British people were shocked by what she had to say.
“I think a lot of British people, the people who responded to me, were fairly astonished. They didn’t understand that the Good Friday Agreement is a truce, a ceasefire. They just didn’t understand that. They don’t seem to understand that Ireland is a sovereign country and that it is Europe,” she said.

Echoing her comments last night that the UK cannot “shaft” Ireland if it wants a US trade deal after Brexit, Greer said: ”The truth of America is that it’s an Irish country. Many Americans can trace Irish ancestry and not just white Americans.”
Greer, who writes for the New European newspaper, said that she’d received thanks from all over the world after the show.
Last night, she was critical of the UK government’s approach to Brexit and said that it needed to take peace in the North more seriously.
“The Good Friday Agreement, in spite of its rather benign name, the Good Friday Agreement is a truce.
“And it’s a truce because the United States of America and the EU sat down with this country to make it happen. We have to be much more serious about this,” Greer said, to applause from the audience.

Timmermans said his view changed after hearing then-Brexit Secretary David Davis, who later stepped down, speaking in public.
“I saw him not coming, not negotiating, grandstanding elsewhere [and] I thought, ‘Oh my God, they haven’t got a plan, they haven’t got a plan.’

“That was really shocking, frankly, because the damage if you don’t have a plan…
“Time’s running out and you don’t have a plan. It’s like Lance Corporal Jones (from sitcom Dad’s Army), you know, ‘Don’t panic, don’t panic!’ Running around like idiots.”
Facing the consequences
In a separate interview with Panorama, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said Theresa May’s rejected Brexit deal was the “only way to leave the EU in an orderly manner”.
When asked what would happen if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, an increasingly likely scenario, Bariner said: “The UK will have to face the consequences.”
May’s successor, either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, is expected to beannounced later this month.
Britain is due to leave the EU on 31 October. Plans are being made at British, Irish and European levels in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

TORY LEADERSHIP CANDIDATE Rory Stewart has said that he would set up a Citizen’s Assembly in Britain to solve Brexit if he became Prime Minister.
“That would be like a jury, selected very scientifically across the country, whittled down to be representative of the country as a whole, give them three weeks to go through the details of it, and then make recommendations,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.
Stweart said 50,000 people would get a phone call or a letter in late July, and there would be an equal split of “north against south, men against women, Brexit against no Brexit”.
“And the reason to do it is to release the pressure from parliament, parliament is gridlocked,” he said, adding that he would give MPs one last chance to fix that gridlock, before passing it on to a Citizens’ Assembly.

He added: “this is what they did in Ireland on abortion, and actually really worked”.
Stewart also said that a customs union, if it meant frictionless trade, would be “a good thing for the British economy”.
“What I want is there in the Prime Minister’s Withdrawal Agreement, I want frictionless trade, I want the thing that 270 MPs voted for, and we have to get 45 more on board.

On the same programme, Foreign Secretary and Tory leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt said that EU leaders had indicated to him that they were willing to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement to remove the backstop, which the EU has repeatedly said is not up for renegotiation.
“I’m not saying this is going to be easy,” Hunt said. When asked if French President Emmanuel Macron, or German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that they were willing to renegotiate the Brexit deal, Hunt said:
“What they’ve said is that they are prepared to look at the whole package, and in particular they’re willing to look at whether you can get much more detail on the future relationship so that you don’t need a backstop.”
Hunt said that if they are approached with “the right British Prime Minister”, they’re willing to look at the Brexit deal again with changes.

https://www.thejournal.ie/regina-doherty-pension-increase-4711741-Jul2019/,"MINISTER FOR SOCIAL Protection Regina Doherty said that she can’t guarantee any social welfare payment increases in next year’s Budget due to the uncertainty around Brexit.
The deadline for the UK to leave the EU is 31 October; the Budget for next year is announced on Tuesday 8 October this year.
Speaking to reporters at Dublin Castle, Minister Doherty said that she couldn’t guarantee that pensions would increase in the next Budget, and said that this was because she couldn’t guarantee the outcome of Brexit.
Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe released two scenarios in the Budget; one for if there was a Brexit deal with the EU, and one for if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
If there’s a no-deal Brexit, it could mean that there are increased tariffs for imports and exports, and that this would damage the Irish economy substantially due to Ireland’s close trading relationship with the UK.

Responding to comments she made earlier on Newstalk Breakfast, Doherty said that it was only “imprudent” to increase pensions by €9 in the context of this year’s Budget.
“I think it would be wrong of me to tell Age Action [that we have] absolutely no problem with [a €9 increase to pensions].
“Indexing against an agreed target I think is a good thing, but I also think that doing specific targeted measures to address people who are living in consistent and persistent poverty, or at least at risk of poverty, is far more beneficial when you only have so much money to spend.
“If we keep doing [it by giving a] fiver across the board [to] everybody – first of all it kind of diminishes in the value but secondly it doesn’t actually hit the people who really need the attention from the State the most.
“There’s 120,000 children who are living in consistent poverty, they don’t get helped by a fiver across the board, they get helped by targeted increases in the Qualified Child Payment. They get helped by school meals programmes and school books in their school.”
Doherty said that there would be a “social welfare package” in the next Budget, but added: “I won’t be making promises to anybody.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/g7-summit-boris-johnson-donald-tusk-4781380-Aug2019/,"LAST UPDATE|25 Aug 2019
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said the chances of a Brexit deal with the EU are now “touch and go”.
Speaking to the BBC at the G7 summit in France, Johnson said the final outcome “all depends on our EU friends and partners”.
“I think it’s going to be touch and go. But the important thing is to get ready to come out without a deal”.
Johnson, who has consistently said the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, is set to seek concessions from the EU on Brexit and meet EU Council President Donald Tusk as the G7 continues today.
The meeting on the margins of the summit will follow a verbal clash between the pair yesterday,when Tusk warned Johnsonnot to go down in history as “Mr No-Deal”.
Johnson today told the BBC: “I think in the last few days there has been a dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals what the shape of the problem is for the UK.”
He added that he was an “optimist” and that he thought the EU understands there is an “opportunity to do a deal”.

Separately, Johnson toldSky Newsthe chances of a Brexit deal are “improving” for the UK after he said it will only pay €9 billion instead of the €41.8 billion liability agreed by his predecessor Theresa May under a no-deal Brexit scenario.
“I think in the last few days we’ve had quite a lot of success in landing some messages about what the UK can do and can’t do,” Johnson said.
“Let’s be clear, I think at the moment there’s a reasonable chance that we’ll get a deal.
‘Considerable barriers’
Johnson has  attempted to distance himself from Trump in the lead up to G7 talks, after previously facing accusations of being too cosy with the American leader.
He urged Trump to remove the “considerable barriers” for UK companies seeking to export to the American market, saying they risked impeding a free-trade deal after Brexit.

Johnson pointed to a string of UK products – including shower trays and pork pies – that he said were not allowed on the American market.
“We intend to seize those opportunities but they are going to require our American friends to compromise and to open up their approach, because currently there are too many restrictions,” he said.
In another provocative comment, he said that US tech giants like Facebook and Google should be taxed “fairly and properly” on their revenues.
However, the first face-to-face talks between the pair saw the US President back him Johnson as the “right man” to deliver Brexit for Britain.
Asked what his advice was for Brexit, Trump replied: “He [Johnson] needs no advice, he is the right man for the job.”
“I’ve been saying that for a long time,” added Trump, noting that such comments had not made his predecessor Theresa May happy while she was still in office up to July.
Diplomatic battlefield
G7 summits, which are attended by the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, were once a meeting of like-minded allies, but have become a diplomatic battlefield under Trump.
Host President Emmanuel Macron wants to make the three-day meeting of the group of seven nations, which started yesterday, an example for international forums.
In an attempt to break the ice, he treated Trump to an unscheduled lunch as soon as he arrived on Air Force One.
Speaking to reporters in English, Macron called Trump “a very special guest” and aides later said that the two men had found some common ground, notably on the Iran nuclear crisis.
G7 chiefs are also hoping to soothe tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme and persuade Trump to ease his policy of “maximum pressure”, including lifting sanctions on Iranian oil sales to China and India.
Macron is also pushing for action against fires in the Amazon rainforest, despite Brazilian right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro’s angry response to what he sees as outside interference.
In a break from previous meetings of the group, there will be no final statement based on late night talks in the southern town of Biarritz.
13,000 police are on duty in the town, where an anti-capitalism demonstration in nearby Bayonne yesterday saw several hundred people attempt to charge police barricades before being repelled with water cannons and tear gas.

https://www.thejournal.ie/northern-ireland-consent-vote-brexit-4856010-Oct2019/,"IT’S BEEN Abig day for Brexit, with a deal finally being agreed by both UK and EU sides today.
While many are still urging caution, with the deal yet to get Westminster approval, there are a number of changes to this agreement compared to the one former UK Prime Minister Theresa May got over the line.
Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a set of EU rules under this deal.
On the issue of customs, there will still be a customs and regulatory border on the Irish sea. British authorities can apply tariffs to goods entering the UK , as long as goods entering Northern Ireland are not at risk of crossing the border and entering the single market.
If goods are going to enter the single market by travelling across the border from the North across the border into Ireland, EU tariffs will be applied.
The role of Stormont in deciding Northern Ireland’s regulations, one of the sticking points for the DUP, was described by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier as a “cornerstone of the newly agreed approach”.
Why was consent a sticking point?
Both the Taoiseach and Tánaistehad concerns about proposalstabled by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, namely the suggestion of letting Stormont decide whether to opt in to the proposed all-island regulatory zone post-Brexit.
Stormont voting mechanisms allow a bloc of either unionist or nationalist Assembly members to block a decision, even if the majority vote for it.
Simon Coveney said that a minority cannot have a veto in such matters, though DUP leader Arlene Foster said the proposals would ensure that Northern Ireland could not be “trapped at the whim of Dublin or the EU”.
Today, Leo Varadkar said this new deal will ensure that only with the consent of the elected representatives of Northern Ireland will this arrangement continue into the future.
Advertisement
So, how does this consent issue work?
If the deal is passed by Westminster on Saturday, the UK will leave the EU, as scheduled on 31 October.
At that point, the transition period will kick in, and will last until December 2020. There is an option for an additional extension of one to two years.
The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will not seek one, but if he were to change his mind, he would have to seek one by the 31 July 2020.
But working on the assumption that no extension is needed, these new consent rules would be in place for four years from the end of the Brexit transition period of December 2020.
So when will the first vote take place?
From the period of October and December 2024, the first vote will held.
How does the vote work?
Elected members of the Northern Ireland Assembly will be asked to vote on whether they want the arrangements to continue or whether they want to leave the arrangements behind.
This is not a vote that falls under the strict definitions of the Good Friday Agreement, because it is actually an international agreement, and therefore is a matter for the UK government. The distinction here is this voting mechanism is not a devolved matter for Northern Ireland alone.
The vote works whereby if a simple majority of MLAs present for the vote decide to continue with the arrangements (say 48 to 51 votes) then the arrangements will continue for anotherfour years.
However, if a majority of elected MLAs present for the vote (60% or more) decide to continue with the arrangements, then they will continue for a period ofeight yearsbefore another vote is held.
This is known as a “cross community” agreement which will give an extended period of certainty in the North.
Related ReadsAs it happened: Focus turns to House of Commons after last-minute Brexit deal endorsed by EU leadersExplainer: Where has the Northern Ireland backstop gone?
How many votes are held every four or eight years?
There is just one vote held each time. Those voting in Stormont declare if they are in the nationalist, unionist or other bloc. By looking at the result of this one vote, it can be determined whether there has been a majority / cross-community approval or whether there has been a simple majority.
What if the Assembly votes to opt out of the arrangement?
The deal provides for a two-year cooling off period after that decision is taken. An EU-UK joint committee is then set up and will be tasked with ensuring the terms of the Good Friday Agreement are protected.
But Stormont hasn’t sat since early 2017 – what happens if it is still shut down when a vote is due to take place?
If Stormont gets up and running only to collapse again when a vote is due to be held, the current deal sets out that the same procedure will take place, regardless.
A vote would take place outside the normal structures of Stormont. The Assembly, made up of MLAs, would still be elected representatives, and therefore can have their say.
Everyone seems to be on board but the DUP, why?
Unlike arrangements under the Good Friday Agreement, there will be no option for a veto, as there usually would be in these types of votes in Stormont.
The DUP believes the new arrangements will become the settled position in Northern Ireland, stating that the new deal “drives a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast Agreement”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-gove-no-deal-4791781-Sep2019/,"UK CABINET MINISTER Michael Gove has refused to guarantee the government would abide by legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit if it passes after being proposed by MPs this week.
Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer toldBBC’s Andrew Marr Showthat MPs who want to prevent a no-deal Brexit will seek to bring forward legislation this week.
“The legislation is intended to ensure we don’t leave without a deal, that will require an extension,” he said.
“The length of the extension is secondary, frankly. We have simply got to stop us leaving without a deal.”
Also speaking on Marr’s show today, Gove refused to rule out ignoring such a law if it was passed. When asked whether the government would abide by this legislation, he responded:
Starmer said it was “breathtaking” that Gove would not confirm whether the government would accept and comply with the legislation.
“The Prime Minister must make a statement on this straightaway,” he said. “No government is above the law.”

‘Not optimistic’
Meanwhile EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Marnier has said the blocwill not change the deal agreed with Britainand he is “not optimistic” of avoiding a no-deal outcome.
Barnier said the most contentious element of the agreement, the backstop mechanism aimed at keeping the Northern Irish border open in all circumstances, must remain.
The British prime minister has said he was encouraged in his bid to axe the backstop by recent meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who appeared to suggest an openness to alternatives.
But writing in theSunday Telegraphtoday, Barnier said Brussels remained unconvinced after “intense discussions with EU member states on the need to guarantee the integrity of the EU’s Single Market, while keeping that border fully open”.

“The backstop is the maximum amount of flexibility that the EU can offer to a non-member state,” he wrote.
“I am not optimistic about avoiding a ‘no deal’ scenario but I remain determined to explore all avenues that the UK government will present that are compatible with the withdrawal agreement.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/how-likely-early-election-uk-brexit-4767134-Aug2019/,"WILL HE? WON’T he?
Westminster is abuzz with talk of whether there’ll be an early election and whether Boris Johnson will time it to force through a no-deal Brexit.
Many MPs are deeply opposed to his threat to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October no matter what, with someworking on a planto take over Commons business in the coming weeks and legislate to avert a no-deal exit.
There’s speculation that Johnson could call an early election to strengthen his mandate for a no-deal.
And there’s also a chance that, as part of a bid to further delay Brexit, the opposition will attempt to form a coalition with some rebel Tories to topple Johnson and force an election once parliament returns in the first week of September.
However it all develops, it’s likely Johnson will be the figure with most control over the timing of any election, and he could set the date for after 31 October when, as things currently stand, a no-deal exit will be the default outcome.
Johnson has been unwavering in his assertion that the UK will exit the European Union “do or die” by the current deadline of 31 October.
The standoff between the two sides now appears intractable: Johnson and his newly-minted ministers say the backstophasto go while the EU leadership continues to insist thatwon’thappen and that the thrice-rejected withdrawal deal remains the only show in town.
Both sides have been stepping up preparations for a disorderly split.
ITV political editor Robert Peston summed up the current state of affairs pretty succinctlyin a blog postthis afternoon:
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
MPs have previously voted against a no-deal Brexit, but it still remains the default scenario if no divorce agreement is struck with the EU.
Parliament could in the first instance try to pass laws to force the government to delay or even reverse Brexit.
Think-tank the Institute for Government has warned in a new report however that the window of opportunity is closing fast. There’s not much time left in the calendar, even if the cross-party group of MPs opposed to no-deal manages to call off the traditional autumn recess for party conferences.
Accordingto the report:
Jeremy Corbyn could also call a confidence vote as part of an alternative bid to avert a no-deal.

While any MP can put a no confidence motion forward, they have no guarantee it will be debated. If Corbyn, as leader of the opposition, tabled one it would have to be and the government would be compelled to clear time in the Commons.
If Johnson loses a confidence vote, he would have 14 days to prove he had the support of a majority of MPs or call an election.
Corbyn could attempt to secure a majority too. A far less likely scenario could see a compromise candidate put forward to lead a new government. Given the tribal nature of politics in the UK, however, it’s unlikely opposition parties and rebel Tories would be able to agree on an alternative candidate.
The 14-day procedure, introduced under the 2011 Fixed Term Parliaments Act, has never been used before and there is a debate as to how it would work.
Catherine Haddon of the Institute for Government says that even if an alternative prime minister were found, Johnson would have to first resign – and he could refuse.
In this case, or if no alternative were chosen, he could stay on for the 14 days and call an election at the time of his choosing.
Here’s how the Institute for Government sets out the current state of affairs (once again, this isfrom the reportmentioned in the section above):
PA Wire / PA ImagesPA Wire / PA Images / PA Images
Analysis by the House of Commons library suggests there is time for a new government to be in place before October 31 – but time is tight.
An election campaign must last a minimum of 25 working days, plus a day or two for the Queen to formally dissolve parliament.
If forced to hold a vote, Johnson has the power to set the date of the election, and might delay.
One of his top aides, Dominic Cummings, believes this is an option if parliament plays hardball, according to a Sunday Telegraph report last weekend. Cummings, who’s also the former head of the Vote Leave campaign, is reported to have said:
MPs could however use the 14 days after a confidence vote to pass legislation demanding an early election – or a Brexit delay.
It’s being speculatedin the Spectatortoday that 10 October is Johnson’s best bet for holding a snap election, if he wanted to take control of the process himself from the outset.
With the support of two thirds of MPs, he could call an election in early September and fix the October date – leaving rivals unable to enact any legislation while parliament is dissolved and, once he receives a mandate, putting Johnson firmly in the driving seat for the EU summit due to be held later in October.
Or so the theory goes.

Traditional party support has splintered in the years since the Brexit vote, making the final makeup of the next House of Commons difficult to call.
Related ReadsExplainer: Could Britain's next PM 'lock the doors of parliament' to force Brexit through?
Johnson’s team are said to be working up a campaign pitching “people versus politicians”, promising to deliver Brexit. But if parliamentary proceedings this year have taught us anything it’s that that there’s still a wide range of opinions on the matter on the Tory benches.
Labour is struggling with divisions over Brexit, coupled with separate rows over anti-Semitism in the party and confidence in Corbyn’s leadership – but the party did better than expected in 2017 and could do so again.
The divisions in the two main parties leave an opportunity for smaller parties with clear positions on Brexit to make gains.
The eurosceptic vote risks being split between the Conservatives and Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, which topped the polls in May’s European elections.
A revamped Lib Dems, who back remain, are on course to gain seats. Anti-Brexit parties are also discussing an alliance that could take seats from Labour and the Tories
A poll this week put support for the Conservatives on 31% and Labour on 27% with the Brexit Party and Lib Dems on 16% each.

Speculation about how the new session of parliament will play out stepped up a gear today as Corbyn threw down the gauntlet to opposition parties, calling on them to back his no-confidence bid and install him as a caretaker PM.
The Labour leader said that if he won a no-confidence motion he planned to seek an extension to Article 50, after which he would attempt to call a general election (again, this would require a two-thirds majorityunder the Fixed-term Parliaments Act).
Labour would campaign for a second referendum in that election, Corbyn’s letter to other party leaders and senior backbenchers said.
Basedon the mixed reactionso far to the Corbyn letter, at this moment it appears unlikely he’ll have enough support. In the most damning response from leaders of other groupings Change UK’s Anna Soubry said the Labour leader ”doesn’t even command respect and support from his own party never mind across the political divide”.
Jo Swinson, the new leader of the Lib Dems, dismissed the idea out of hand – describing the plan as nonsense. Other parties, including Scotland’s SNP and Plaid Cymru of Wales have been more amenable.
The BBC’s political correspondent Tom Bartonsaid todayit appeared the numbers weren’t stacking up for the Labour leader.
“There are plenty of MPs who say they want to stop a no-deal Brexit but getting them to agree on how to do it – that’s a different matter altogether,” he added.
Who knows.
But here are some dates to keep an eye on:

THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE took to the streets of Edinburgh calling for a fresh referendum on Scottish independence just weeks out from the Brexit deadline.
The demonstrators, many carrying Scottish flags and some wearing kilts and playing musical instruments – including bagpipes – set off from Holyrood Park in the heart of the Scottish capital.
Among them was lawyer and Scottish Nationalist (SNP) lawmaker Joanna Cherry, who was behind one of the successful legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament.
She was also one of main backers of a law passed last month forcing Johnson to ask the European Union for more time to avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal.
The group organising Saturday’s march, All Under One Banner, said it was hoping to get 100,000 people to attend.

Scotland voted against independence in a 2014 referendum by 55 percent.
But nationalists argue that the 2016 British referendum in favour of Brexit means another independence referendum is necessary — because Scotland voted by 62 percent to stay in the EU.
Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the SNP, has argued that Brexit will devastate the economy.
Nationalists also argue that some people voted against independence thinking it would guarantee their place inside the EU.
Sturgeon, who wants a second independence referendum in 2021, did not attend the march, but tweeted a message of support.
Some independence activists also joined the march, while a few pro-Union protesters carrying Union Jack flags staged a small counter-demonstration.

https://www.thejournal.ie/newspaper-front-pages-boris-johnson-4737257-Jul2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON WAS yesterday elected leader of the Conservative Party in Britain, following a vote by about 160,000 party members.
He was elected by 92,153 votes to 46,656, securing support from 66.4% of the party members who voted.
Some 87.4% of the eligible 159,320 members cast a vote in the leadership contest.
Despite accusations ofspreading misinformationand seemingly not being up to speed ontrade regulations, pro-Brexit Boris Johnson was always the frontrunner to succeed Theresa May, seeing off competition from Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.
May is expected to answer her final prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons today before officially handing in her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II.
Johnson is not likely to enjoy any type of honeymoon period, given the looming Brexit deadline of 31 October – a target he has promised to meet.
From ‘To insanity and beyond’ to ‘It’s really not funny anymore’, here is how British newspapers are covering the story:

https://www.thejournal.ie/central-bank-groceries-brexit-4845924-Oct2019/,"THE CENTRAL BANK has warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to increased grocery costs for consumers but said that several factors could help retailers keep prices down.
The price warning and the effects of a hard Brexit on the economy have been brought into sharp focus by the Central Bank in its latest quarterly bulletin.
The Central Bank’s report looked at the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on the price of groceries, noting that “increased tariffs and trade costs may be passed on to consumers”.
On the cost of trade, the research points to “additional shipping costs to Ireland” if goods are required to comes from further afield than the UK.
It adds that the sectors most exposed are bread and cereals.
Despite this, analysts within the Central Bank have said that there are several factors that may guard against consumers actually having to pay higher costs for their groceries.
Among those factors are an overall profitability within the Irish retail sector which means that supermarkets may have enough room within their margins to keep costs down.
“One implication of that, for example, is there’s maybe a little bit more scope, either for retailers to absorb some of the higher transport and trade costs, but also maybe more inclination for UK retailers to stay in this market, because of higher profitability, in the event that their trade costs become more expensive,” explained the Central Bank’s director of economics and statistics Mark Cassidy.

Jobs
On the wider economy, the report says that a no-deal Brexit could cost Ireland an estimated 73,000 jobs by the end of 2021 and increase unemployment from its current rate of 5.3% to 6.9% over that period.
The figure of 73,000 takes account of both job losses and the cost of jobs not created that might otherwise enter the economy if an orderly Brexit takes place.
These lost jobs would be in the sectors most vulnerable to the effects of Brexit such as agriculture and tourism.
However, the Central Bank is predicting that if a deal is secured, the country could ride out the effects of Brexit to actually decrease unemployment over that period to 4.8% in 2020 and 2021.
The nature of Brexit would also have a significant effect on the potential for GDP growth, with the Central Bank saying a figure of 4.3% could be achieved next year if there’s a deal. That figure plunges to 0.8% in a no-deal scenario.
The two predictions mean it is the first time the Central Bank has published two forecasts for the Irish economy, with Cassidy saying Brexit makes the current situation “extraordinary and unprecedented”.
The 84-page report says that a no-deal Brexit would represent “significant disruption and the negative shock” to the Irish economy but also points out that no-deal job losses would be much worse outside of Dublin.
Cassidy says that agriculture employs one in 14 people across the economy as a whole compared to one in 33 people in Dublin. In some areas, such as in Cavan/Monaghan, that figure is as high as one in five.
“Rural areas in particular are most affected, tourism of course is spread across many rural areas. In terms of agricultural and food, several different statistics are important, the first is employment in agriculture and food, which is highest in the border regions and then in midlands and in midwest.”
On Dublin, he adds that several factors could help shield the city from the worst effects of Brexit job losses:
“You will also see some positive impact, but I would not overstate this, from new financial sector firms relocating to Dublin in the coming years. So the impact is expected to be lessened.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/martin-brexit-english-boris-johnson-4859640-Oct2019/,"FIANNA FÁIL LEADER Micheál Martin has blamed a “self-regarding and imperially-minded English elite” for Brexit during a speech to commemorate Wolfe Tone in Bodenstown in Kildare.
Martin, who has largely backed the government’s handling of the negotiations with the UK, said the “Brexit shambles” was a “tragedy for all who understand the lessons of the past and believe in the principle of cooperation between peoples and nations”.
“It is rooted on an extreme prejudice against rules-based cooperation and a narrow nationalism which has a history of delivering short-term highs and long-term misery,” he added.
Martin was speaking as thefall-out overthe House of Common’s Brexit vote continues, which saw MPs vote to force Boris Johnson to request an extension from the EU and effectively scuppering his hopes of leaving before 31 October.

The vote came only days after the UK and the EU reached a new deal on Thursday. The deal came following a frantic few days of negotiations, sparked by a meeting between Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Johnson.
Martin said that the deal should not be “celebrated”.
“While last weeks deal may be welcome, it still contains genuine uncertainty in important areas and it proposes to cement a hard Brexit,” Martin said today.
Martin was also critical of the arrangements for Northern Ireland, whichwould see the Assembly voteby a simple majority either every four or eight years on whether or not to continue to maintain a close customs relationship with the EU – an arrangement designed to avoid a hard border.
The next steps in the Brexit saga remain somewhat unclear. The EU is currently weighing up how to respond to Johnson’s extension request, while the UK government is insisting that the country can still leave before 31 October.
The next week may also bring a vote on a second referendum in the House of Commons, as well as another meaningful vote on Johnson’s deal.

Martin, whose party is in a confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael, also said that Varadkar, who has said that hewants an electionnext May, will not “set the agenda” for an election.
Martin did not indicate when he wanted an election. “It will be set by the concerns of the Irish people,” he said.
“Whenever the election happens this government will be held to account for its many and growing failures,” he added.

Organised by the People’s Vote campaign, which has been calling for a second referendum on EU membership, the meeting in the Ulster Hall heard from various speakers the damaging consequences of Brexit.
Northern Ireland, set to be worst-hit by Brexit, has been at the centre of negotiations as the UK and the EU have clashed over the border and the backstop.
Hundreds of people turned out at the end of a dramatic week in the UK, where the highest civil court in Scotland had found that Johnsonhad misled the queenover his reasons for suspending parliament andthe prime minister failed– for the second time – to persuade parliament to back an early election.

“My message as MEP has been that the UK is now in serious political crisis. That Johnson’s objective is to blame the UK parliament and the EU. Don’t be part of his plan. Give us the extension. Hold the prime minister’s feet to the fire and make him negotiate,” she told the crowd.
Speaking ahead of the meeting, Hanna, whose party has opposed Brexit, said that it is “profoundly undemocratic to attempt to force a wretched no deal on the people without their democratic consent”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/emma-desouza-loses-citizenship-case-appeal-4850391-Oct2019/,"LAST UPDATE|14 Oct 2019
THE UK’S HOME Office has won its appeal against an immigration tribunal ruling which found that people born in Northern Ireland are not automatically British.
The woman at the centre of the case,Emma DeSouza, has said she is “understandably devastated and disappointed by today’s decision” and will appeal it.
DeSouza, from Magherafelt in Co Derry, applied for a residence card for her US-born husband Jake in 2015. She made the application identifying herself as an Irish citizen.
The Home Office rejected the application on the grounds that it considered Emma DeSouza a British citizen. UK officials had told her she should either reapply identifying herself as British, or renounce her UK citizenship and reapply as an Irish citizen.
The Derry woman argued that she never considered herself British, so how could she renounce citizenship she never had.

DeSouza took a legal challenge against the Home Office and won, with a judge at a First Tier Immigration Tribunal ruling that she was an “Irish national only who has only ever been such”.
The Home Office appealed against that decision at an Upper Tribunal hearing earlier this year. DeSouza revealed the outcome of the appeal at a press conference in Belfast today.
“We have not received a decision in our favour, the decision has gone in the favour of the Secretary of State,” she said.

Sheinsistedher legal battle would go on: “After four years it’s safe to say we won’t be lying down anytime soon.”
DeSouza insists that the Home Office position ran contrary to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which gave anyone from Northern Ireland the right to identify as British, Irish or both.
Speaking onRTÉ Radio 1′s Drivetimethis evening, DeSouza said she is “understandably devastated and disappointed”, adding that the decision amounts to a “rewriting” of the relevant section of the agreement.
“I’m Irish, it wasn’t a choice or a decision, it’s simply who I am … Today’s decision ruled that we don’t have any choice, we are British,” DeSouza said.
She added that she and her husband are “a little overwhelmed by the mounting challenge that lies ahead of us”, and intend to crowdfund the money needed as they are not entitled to legal aid.
British Nationality Act 1981
UK government lawyers argued that the British Nationality Act 1981 was the relevant legislation – not the Good Friday Agreement.
They highlighted that the provisions on citizenship outlined in the agreement, which was struck between the Stormont parties and the UK and Irish Governments, had not been incorporated into the corresponding piece of domestic legislation linked to the peace treaty, the 1998 Northern Ireland Act.
The government said the British Nationalist Act ruled that anyone born in Northern Ireland was automatically British, until such time as they renounce that citizenship.
Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
DeSouza has accused the UK Government of failing to implement the provisions of Good Friday Agreement into UK domestic law. She said her case will have implications for EU citizens post-Brexit.

The case was being monitored by a representative of the Irish government. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald responded to the verdict by tweeting: “Irish people are Irish”.
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “Emma is Irish. The Good Friday Agreement guarantees that right for all citizens on this island.
“The failure to uphold the agreement in law is unacceptable and must be addressed. I’ll be raising this with the Secretary of State.”
Responding to the judgement, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that Tánaiste Simon Coveney is aware of this morning’s decision.
“The Tánaiste has had a number of discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to raise the case of Emma DeSouza, the concerns in relation to the citizenship and identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, and to ask for a review of the issues.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/paschal-donohoe-parliament-suspension-4785587-Aug2019/,"LAST UPDATE|28 Aug 2019
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT “seems to be simply wiping the slate clean on the Irish issue in terms of the commitments that they’ve made” in the withdrawal agreement, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said today.
Speaking in Paris this afternoon, Coveney said “it is hard to tell” if the suspension of the UK parliament makes a no-deal Brexit more likely now.
“It’s hard to tell how the British political system will respond to that. And really, that’s a matter for parliament. And I’ve always been careful not to get involved in the parliamentary business of Westminster. They have a sovereign parliament, they have to make difficult decisions and choices,” he said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnsonspoke to the queen this morningabout suspending parliament from the second week in September until 14 October, less than two weeks before the UK is set to leave the European Union.
The move is said to give MPs almost no time to pass new laws that could prevent a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.
In a letter to MPs this morning, Johnson said the current session needed to come to a close, and that he would schedule a Queen’s Speech – laying out the government’s plans – to launch new legislation in October.
While Coveney said the decision to suspend the parliament in London is a matter for the British parliament, he criticised their approach to matters, stating:

Coveney met with the UK Secretary of State in Paris today, where they had a 45 minute meeting at the Irish Embassy.
A spokesperson stated that Coveney relayed the “consistent and long-held position of the EU and Ireland and spoke of the compromise between the UK and the EU that lead to the Withdrawal Agreement”.
Speaking to reporters, Coveney said all parties have worked for the last two years to ensure the deal is fair from all sides, ensuring the peace process on the island of Ireland is protected and at the same time preventing physical border infrastructure re-emerging.
“And now we have a British government who seems to be simply wiping the slate clean on the Irish issue in terms of the commitments that they’ve made. And we can never sign an agreement with that approach. And so we’ve always said, if there is to be a no-deal Brexit, it will be the choice of a British Prime Minister under British Parliament to allow that to happen.
“We want a sensible deal based on the negotiations that have taken place over the last three years Ireland is reasonable, and has always shown flexibility and a willingness to compromise. But we’re not going to compromise on a peace process that is fragile right now on the island of Ireland.”

Calling back the Dáil
Speaking earlier today, Finance and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe said a request for the Dáil to return early from its summer break due to the ongoing Brexit situation will be “seriously considered”.
Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said he will ask the Taoiseach to use his powers under Dáil Standing Order 26 to initiate an early recall of the House to discuss the evolving Brexit Crisis.“As it stands the Dáil is due to return on the 17th of September, by which time the House of Commons will already have been prorogued with an increasing likelihood of a ‘no-deal Brexit’.
“We cannot control the increasingly fraught developments in Westminster but we should have the Dáil in session to make sure that our response is debated in full,” he saidRyan said returning earlier in September would be an important recognition of the scale of the crisis Ireland faces.

When asked onRTÉ’s News at Oneabout the prospect of politicians returning to Leinster House early, Donohoe said “we will consider seriously the request he [Ryan] has just made”.
However, he added that whether there would be an early Dáil return would be a matter for the Taoiseach.
Donohoe said the government is open to “any sort of engagement” the opposition parties want on the on-going Brexit issues, with the minister describing the Brexit situation as “fast-moving”.
Donohoe would not be drawn on matters taking place in London, stating that he believes it is for others to comment as to what the intentions of Boris Johnson are.
The minister said his focus is getting Ireland ready for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, reiterating that it is a growing, material risk.
Changes to the backstop ruled out
When asked if today’s developments in the UK will mean changes to the Irish backstop, the minister was clear, replying: “No.”
He said he is focused on the issues that extend beyond tomorrow, stating that avoiding instability on the island of Ireland is his priority.
All the work that went into the withdrawal agreement negotiations was focused on that issue, which is why the principle of regulatory alignment is “critical” and “embedded” in the backstop, he said.
The Tánaiste said today that if the UK needs furthers reassurances on the backstop, they are open to talks.

https://www.thejournal.ie/coveney-brexit-dup-4836944-Oct2019/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has said “there is scope for change” in the British government’s Brexit proposal.
Speaking onRTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke programmethis morning, Coveney reiterated that the proposals form the basis of further discussion but not the basis for an agreement.
Boris Johnson’s proposals plans to replace the Irish backstop, which is meant to avoid border checks, by introducing Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland custom checks.
The proposed customs arrangement is the “main problem” in the plans put forward, said Coveney.
The UK Prime Minister has proposed the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be a customs border, but said that does not mean that customs checks and controls need to take place at, or even near, that border.
Such an arrangement has been widely dismissed by those in Northern Ireland and by some in the UK, said Coveney. He said MPs, MLAs, businesses and business groups both on the island of Ireland and the UK have said “this will not work”.
“That’s simply not going to work,” he said.
Yesterday, the DUP leader has accused the Irish Government of trying to ride roughshod over unionism, as she criticised Dublin’s rejection of the UK’s latest Brexit plan.
Arlene Foster
Arlene Foster’s comments came after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Coveney both voiced opposition to the proposals.
Both men expressed concern at the suggestion of letting Stormont decide whether to opt in to the proposed all-island regulatory zone post-Brexit.
Stormont voting mechanisms allow a bloc of either unionist or nationalist Assembly members to block a decision, even if the majority vote for it.
Foster said the proposals would ensure that Northern Ireland could not be “trapped at the whim of Dublin or the EU”.

“Simon Coveney’s remarks are deeply unhelpful, obstructionist and intransigent,” she said, adding:
She said Coveney’s rejection of a “reasonable offer is paving the road for a no-deal exit because unionism will not allow Northern Ireland to be trapped at the whim of Dublin or the EU. We will not buy that”.
This morning, Coveney said he did not want “a quarrel” with the DUP, but said Ireland cannot back a Brexit deal which lets minority veto wishes of majority.
“We can’t have a situation where a minority of people in Northern Ireland are vetoing decisions,” he said.
“We want to help him get a deal and work through the Michel Barnier taskforce through the negotiations to get that deal in place,” he added.
Border security
When asked about the Chief Constable of the PSNI Matt Baggott stating this morning that he will not staff border security, Coveney said Baggot has been “consistent” in his views on Brexit and what it means for the borde.
He said the chief constable has concerns. “He is very worried about the prospect of border infrastructure,” said the Tánaiste.
“I am too,” he added, stating that the gardaí shares these concerns.
There is a “serious security risk”, said Coveney, who added: “That is not me flaring up the issue.”
For anyone to look at the border and only seeing it as “a trade facility issue misses the point here”.
The border issue is about “identity” and “emotion”, as well as the trauma that physical infrastructure on the border caused in the past, he said.
“That is why it is so emotive politically,” he concluded.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-column-the-sun-4839328-Oct2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS penned a column aimed at the EU inthe Sun on Sundaynewspaper today, telling the union that the UK will be “walking out” on 31 October.
In the column, Johnson says that the exit comes “after decades of campaigning, three years of arguments and seemingly endless months of pointless delay”.
The Tory leader says that right now the only question that remains is whether Brussels waves the UK off with a mutually agreeable deal, or “whether we will be forced to head off on our own”.
He mentions hisproposals published last week– which he describes as a “practical compromise” – that he believes would help to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both sides.

Doubling down on his description of the backstop as ‘anti-democratic’, he says his plan would respect the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.
In short, writes Johnson, his new plan “gets Brexit done on October 31″.
Meanwhile, UK Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the BBC’s Andrew Marr on Sunday show today that Britain is open to discussing the mechanism for how politicians in Northern Ireland decide on remaining in regulatory alignment with the EU – as set out in the proposals above.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is expected to meet with Johnson next week – and Varadkarunderlined last nightthat “time is tight” for a Brexit deal to be struck ahead of a European Council summit on 17 and 18 October.
He said he believes a deal can be reached and refused to set out when Johnson should submit any final proposals to the EU, but said that next Friday was “reasonable”.
Asked whether he thinks a deal can be done, Varadkar said:

“It’s possible at the European Council summit in two weeks time, but the current position as of today is the European Union, including Ireland, doesn’t feel that the proposals put forward by Prime Minister Johnson yet form the basis for deeper negotiations.”
He said the Irish government had concerns about the issue of consent and democracy in the North, as well as a serious problem with custom checks.
“That is the hard border we have been trying to avoid all along,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/scotland-court-prorogation-what-happens-law-supreme-court-brexit-4804838-Sep2019/,"SCOTLAND’S HIGHEST CIVIL court has ruled that Boris Johnson’s prorogation of parliament was unlawful.
A summary of the judgement,made this morning, said Johnson’s advice to Queen Elizabeth II that parliament be prorogued from this week until 14 October “was unlawful because it had the purpose of stymying parliament”.
It’s not immediately clear what happens next. There’s a Supreme Court date set for next week, but in the hours since questions have swirled over what the ruling means for the prorogation, parliament and even the queen.
What did the court say?
The Edinburgh court, made up of three judges, found that the decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was unlawful.
We only have a summary of the court’s judgement, but the ruling is still damning. One of the judges, Lord Brodie, found that:
Lord Drummond Young echoed this:
All judges agreed that the reason for prorogation was to restrict parliament’s scrutiny, basically implying that Boris Johnson misled the queen about the reasons for proroguing parliament.
The court stated that it would now make an order “declaring that the Prime Minister’s advice to HM the Queen and the prorogation which followed thereon was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect”.
Who brought the case?
The case was brought by Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry and backed by 75 parliamentarians, as well as campaigner Jolyon Maugham of the Good Law Project.
Last week, in the Outer House of the Court of Session, asingle judge ruledthat prorogation was not illegal and did not breach the rule of law.
This decision was then appealed to the Inner House, which issued today’s dramatic ruling.
Decisions of the Outer House of the Court of Session can be appealed to the Inner House, which typically sits with three judges.
Appeals don’t normally move this fast through the court system, but the process has been sped up because of the urgency of the question over parliament’s suspension.

Why was the case taken in Scotland?
Firstly, prorogation affects Scotland the same as any other part of the UK. On Twitter today,Cherry said thatthe Scottish courts were chosen “because we [Cherry and some of the parliamentarians supporting the case] are Scottish & and they weren’t on holiday”.
She added that the Court of Session is the “Supreme Court of Scotland” – making it a higher court than the court of first instance in England.
Financial Times legal commentator David Allen Green also suggested that Scottish lawwould be morereceptive than English law to this kind of constitutional challenge – although this isn’t an analysis shared byevery legal academic.
Can this decision be appealed?
It can and it will. A date has been set for next Tuesday at the UK Supreme Court. Nine judges are scheduled to sit on 17 September to hear appeals from this case.
Does this mean parliament is going to return from prorogation?
We simplydon’t know. Academics, legal experts and journalists have been arguing all day about what the judgement means.
Scottish law is different and distinct from English law, but that doesn’t mean that a decision of the country’s highest civil court has less legal force than a decision of an English court.
The Court of Sessiondid not issuean order to cancel prorogation, despite ruling that it would make an order declaring that Boris Johnson’s advice to the queen was “unlawful and is thus null and of no effect”.
There are plenty of voices arguing that parliament should now sit again and some MPs have returned to sit in the House of Commonsas an act of protest.
Maugham has said that the decision means that parliamentshould return. Scottish National Party MP Ian Blackford, in a letter to Johnson, said that it is “absolutely imperative that you now act to recall parliament”.
As for the UK government, its position remains unchanged. The prime minister’s spokesperson maintained that proroguing was legal and that parliament “remains prorogued” regardless of the decision.
Things are slightly complicated by the fact that the English High Court ruled last week that prorogationwas not illegal.
There’s also the Northern Ireland case later this week on prorogation – although the legal challenge is based on slightly different ground, namely the 1998 Northern Ireland Act and the Good Friday Agreement.
Both of these cases will also end up in the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

The actual mechanics of parliament returning are also somewhat confusing. As one journalistpointed out, it’s all a bit “Schrodinger’s prorogation”.
Firstly, it’s unclear who can actually enforce the ruling of the Scottish court, especially when the government maintains it is legal and an English High Court has ruled that it was not illegal.
As for John Bercow, who criticised this prorogation as an act of “executive fiat”, the Speaker has said that any decision to accelerate the meeting of parliament during prorogation is a matter for the government.
His choice of word – “accelerate” – is intentional. When it comes to prorogation, the language used is “acceleration”, which basically means that the date of parliament’s next meeting can be brought forward.
Technically, the British parliament can only be “recalled” from a temporary break in a session, such as at weekends or holidays.
Prorogation is made by the queen, on the advice of the government. Only the queen can issue a proclamation to set a new date for parliament’s next sitting.
For one example of the legal wrangling ongoing today, oneSky News journalistsuggested that the court could make a ruling to recall the parliament, but the case is going to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, so it’s likely that all actions will be paused pending that ruling.
However, aformer clerkin the House of Commons has suggested that today’s ruling means that Monday’s sitting of parliament was only suspended, a different legal status that the Speaker could unsuspend. Things might be clearer once we have the full judgement.

Can Boris Johnson ignore the decision?
In the short term, that appears to be the plan – at least ahead of a decision of the Supreme Court.
If the Supreme Court, which also takes appeals from Northern Ireland and Scotland, found that prorogation was unlawful, we could presume that the government would be unable to ignore it and parliament could return from prorogation.
More worryingly, perhaps, for Boris Johnson is the ruling of the Scottish court that Johnson used prorogation to avoid parliamentary scrutiny – basically suggesting that Johnson misled the queen.
If the Supreme Court agreed with this, it would be a major embarrassment for the UK leader and would be impossible to ignore.

https://www.the42.ie/former-qpr-boss-holloway-claims-eu-responsible-for-new-handball-rules-4776272-Aug2019/,"
Updated at 15.41
IAN HOLLOWAY HAS clarified controversial remarks in which he originally appeared to suggest that the European Union is to blame for the controversial new handball rule in the Premier League.
The former Crystal Palace and Blackpool manager faced an online backlash after comments in relation to Gabriel Jesus’ last-minute disallowed goal in the 2-2 draw with Spurs last weekend.
The Brazilian striker thought he had scored the winner in the dying minutes of Saturday’s match at the Etihad, only for VAR to rule out the goal after team-mate Aymeric Laporte was adjudged to have handled the ball in the build-up.
“For me it doesn’t make sense, the handball rule,’ Holloway initially said on Sky Sports’ The Debate.
“And to be fair, is that clear and obvious? They forgot the most important thing of all.
“Their job is to not re-referee the game but to be clear and obvious, so I don’t think that’s our boys making up that new change of law.
“I think that’s people telling us what we need to do with our game, now they should stop doing that.”

With Britain set to leave the European Union in late October, the former QPR manager seemingly suggested the decision would have a positive impact on the English Premier League.
However, Holloway has since clarified his remarks. Speakingto the Mirror, he said: “Brexit is nothing to do with the football rules, is it? I’m not that stupid.”
Holloway added that he was simply drawing a parallel between the EU and Uefa, and their influence over Britain in the respective political and footballing spheres.
“People don’t listen,” Holloway said. “What I’ve said, and I can say it very clearly, is I’m sick and fed up of being told what to do by people who aren’t running our country.
“Fifa and Uefa have brought these rules in, they told us we’ve got to use VAR that I’ve got no problem with, but that handball rule that they’ve made up, I don’t want to listen to them. That’s nonsensical.
“It’s just in the same way that I’m sick and fed up of us in the UK being told what to do by the EU.
“What I’m saying is, as an English person, I’m sick and fed up of being told what we’ve got to do. Our country is fantastic. If you let us make our own rules up, do what we want to do, we’ll be in control of it a lot better.
“Let’s get out and stop the EU dictating to us what we can do. I feel exactly the same with Uefa and Fifa over our football — I think the English FA should have more power and we should believe in ourselves, and I believe the EFL should have more power rather than the Premier League telling them what to do.”


“I don’t like Uefa and I don’t like Fifa telling us what we should do in our English football game. We should take control of our own game, then that wouldn’t have happened.
“We should give the referee an earpiece, so he can explain to the crowd what’s happened with VAR, and we should get rid of that handball rule when you’re checking for goals. It’s unfair and it doesn’t sit well in football.”
The controversial International FA Board rules now mean that a goal can be disallowed if a player handles the ball resulting in an assist, regardless of whether or not there was any intention to do so.
The rules have been met by huge criticism from fans throughout the league, with VAR also under heavy scrutiny.

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-brexit-compromise-4849164-Oct2019/,"THE DUP HAS poured cold water over a reported Brexit compromise to end the deadlock over the Northern Ireland backstop.
Deputy leader Nigel Dodds warned the mooted plan – reportedly being discussed by EU and UK officials in Brussels – “cannot work”.
Reports from the Belgian capital claimed Boris Johnson has sought to revive a proposal first put forward by Theresa May for a customs partnership between the UK and the EU.
The scheme, intended to avoid the need for customs controls on the island of Ireland, would see Northern Ireland remain politically in a customs union with the EU but it would be administered by the UK.
However Dodds – whose party’s votes will almost certainly be needed to get a Brexit deal through Parliament – told the Italian La Repubblica newspaper that Northern Ireland “must stay in a full UK customs union, full stop”.
“It cannot work because Northern Ireland has to remain fully part of the UK customs union,” he said.
He added:
British officials have so far remained tight-lipped in the face of the reports.
The reported plan would create a customs border in the Irish Sea with goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland being subject to tariffs which Britain would collect on behalf of the EU.

Businesses would then be able to claim a rebate once they had shown the goods were for consumption in the UK market.
However, it would mean that Northern Ireland would be able to benefit from any post-Brexit trade deals the UK struck with other countries around the world.
Johnson refused to say whether he had offered a compromiseAlastair Grant / PAAlastair Grant / PA / PA
Speaking during a school visit on Friday, Johnson repeatedly refused to say whether he had offered any concessions on the issue of the customs union.
He stressed however that he would not accept anything that “damages the ability of the whole of the United Kingdom to take full advantage of Brexit”.
Talks have been continuing in Brussels after the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier gave the green light on Friday for intensive discussions between officials to start.
It followed apparent progress in talks on Thursday between Johnson and Leo Varadkar at a country house retreat on the Wirral.
Their discussions appeared to unblock the negotiations which had seemed to have been running into the ground following the publication of Johnson’s Brexit blueprint.
The Prime Minister cautioned it was not a “done deal” and there was still “a way to go” if they were to get an agreement which would enable Britain to leave on 31 October, as he has promised.
Barnier is due to brief EU ambassadors and MEPs on Monday on progress – but time is rapidly running out if they are to get an agreement in place in time for EU leaders to sign off on it at next week’s Brussels summit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-eu-deal-extension-boris-leo-ireland-4838124-Oct2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON SAID that he will not delay Brexit, despite his lawyers saying he will comply with a law calling for the October 31 exit date to be postponed if there is no deal.
However, the chances of his new proposals succeeding were dealt a heavy blow by Brussels, as EU member states agreed they “do not provide a basis for concluding an agreement”.
The prime minister today accepted he must send a letter requesting a delay to Brexit beyond the Halloween deadline if no deal is agreed with Parliament by October 19, Scotland’s highest civil court heard.
But Johnson later said the options facing the country were his proposed new Brexit deal or leaving without an agreement, “but no delay”.
A European Commission spokesman said discussions between the two sides would not take place this weekend but the UK will be given “another opportunity to present its proposals in detail” on Monday.

“Michel Barnier debriefed the Permanent Representatives Committee yesterday, where member states agreed that the UK proposals do not provide a basis for concluding an agreement,” the spokesman added.
The prime minister has previously said “we will obey the law” but will also leave on October 31 in any circumstance, without specifying how he would achieve the apparently contradictory goals – fuelling speculation that he had identified a loophole to get around the Benn Act.
He has also declared he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than ask for a delay.
Any extension to the Article 50 process – the mechanism by which the UK leaves the European Union – would have to be agreed by all 27 other EU leaders.

Speaking in Denmark today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said if Boris Johnson submits a request for an extension, he would agree.

“I’ve always said that Brexit doesn’t end with the UK leaving, it’s just the next phase of negotiations, but if the UK were to request an extension, we would consider it, most EU countries would only consider it for good reason, but an extension would be better than no deal,” he said.
Varadkar was speaking alongside the Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen, who also agreed to a Brexit extension, before he added that he still believes a deal is possible at the EU Council Summit in mid-October.
“Our focus is on securing an agreement and getting a deal at the EU Council Summit,” the Taoiseach added
Tánaiste Simon Coveney, who was in Hillsborough today to meet with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith, also rejected the idea that a deal was “mission impossible”.
“I believe it is possible to get a deal this month,” he said today.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-set-to-meet-varadkar-for-private-brexit-talks-4845244-Oct2019/,"LAST UPDATE|10 Oct 2019
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson have said they “can see a pathway to a possible deal”.
Varadkar and Johnson had a “private one-on-one meeting”  in Cheshire this afternoon in a last-ditch effort to break the  Brexit deadlock as the departure deadline looms and progress with the EU falters.
The meeting is understood to have been three hours long.
In a joint statement, the Taoiseach and UK Prime Minister said they had a “detailed and constructive discussion”.
Their discussions concentrated on “the challenges of customs and consent” as well as the future relationship between the two countries.
The statement continued:
They both agreed to “reflect further on their discussions and that officials would continue to engage intensively on them”.
Following their discussions, the Taoiseach and Irish officials will now consult with and brief the EU Task Force so as to explore whether there is a basis for more intense negotiations  with the task force and the British side.
This will also be a matter discussed between the UK Brexit Secretary and Michel Barnier who are meeting tomorrow morning.
With the crucial EU summit in Brussels starting in a week, the chance of Johnson securing a new Withdrawal Agreement is looking increasingly unlikely.
Varadkar acknowledged ahead of today’s discussion that it will be “very difficult” to secure a deal by next week.
Johnson wants to keep Northern Ireland more closely aligned with the EU than the rest of the UK on rules on goods and agriculture but remove it from the current customs union.
But Varadkar is opposed to the Republic being in a different customs union from the north.

Varadkar and Johnson say they can see a pathway to a Brexit deal.
‘Great difficulty’
Yesterday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said there was still no basis for a fresh agreement on the UK’s withdrawal from the bloc.
He said they had yet to see any “operational, legally binding solution” to the issue of the backstop ahead of next week’s European Council meeting.
Johnson’s “two borders” proposals, he said, were based on a system “that hasn’t been properly developed, that hasn’t been tested”.
The downbeat assessment from Barnier was echoed by the Taoiseach, who said the PM was installing an obstacle to progress by insisting that Northern Ireland must leave the customs union with the rest of the UK.
“That’s their position at the moment and that’s one that is a great difficulty for us,” Mr Varadkar told the Dáil.
“As far as the Irish government is concerned, we do want a deal, we’re willing to work hard to get a deal, to work until the last moment to get a deal, but certainly not at any cost.”
Johnson must bring back a deal before 19 October if he is to avoid a clash over the Benn Act, which aims to prevent a no-deal departure.
As the Brexit deadline looms, Varadkar has indicated that the time in which a deal can be struck is tight.
The legislation orders the PM to ask for a delay to Article 50 until the end of January if MPs do not approve a deal before that date.
But he has repeatedly said he will not ask for a delay, while insisting that he will abide by the law.
Johnson is planning an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament following the summit, to be held on 19 October, according to government sources.
It is thought the Prime Minister could use the occasion to force a showdown with MPs determined to block a no-deal Brexit.

https://www.thejournal.ie/michel-barnier-no-reason-to-be-optimistic-that-brexit-deal-will-be-reached-4806831-Sep2019/,"
EUROPE’S CHIEF NEGOTIATOR Michel Barnier has told European lawmakers that he has no reason to be optimistic that Brussels and London will agree an orderly Brexit deal.
Barnier’s stark assessment came as MEPs said there can be no Brexit deal without the Irish backstop that Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson has demanded be withdrawn from any final agreement.
“I can’t objectively tell you whether the contacts we have undertaken with Mr Johnson’s government will lead to an agreement between now and mid-October,” Barnier told parliamentary group leaders.
Mid-October is when Johnson would have to come to Brussels for a summit of EU leaders with either a new withdrawal agreement or a request for a delay to Brexit, but the British leader insists he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than postpone the 31 October withdrawal.
“We don’t have any reasons to be optimistic,” Barnier said.
Next week, MEPs will vote in the Strasbourg parliament on a motion to reaffirm and reinforce the European negotiating stance – and place the blame for the stalemate in the talks firmly across the Channel in London.
“The resolution stresses a very clear message: you can’t have an agreement without the backstop. It couldn’t really be any clearer,” David Sassoli, the speaker of the European Parliament told reporters in Brussels.

“The resolution says that if there is a no-deal departure, then that is entirely the responsibility of the United Kingdom,” he added at a news conference after Barnier’s briefing.
Barnier said he had received no plausible proposal from Britain as to how the backstop, a measure which sees Britain remain in the EU customs union until a way is found to keep the Irish border open, could be replaced.
“Regarding the talks we are still ready to examine objectively any concrete and legally operable proposals from the UK,” he told reporters.
Johnson’s chief Brexit adviser, diplomat David Frost, was in Brussels yesterday and will return tomorrow for “technical talks” with Barnier’s team, but Number 10 continues to insist that the backstop must go before a deal is signed.
“The UK presented ideas in the areas of customs and manufactured goods and we had further exchanges on the political declaration,” a UK spokesman said, as Britain continues to push alternative technical measures to govern border traffic.
Johnson insists his goal is to reach a new withdrawal deal that would lay the groundwork for negotiating a future free trade agreement with Brussels, but that Britain must leave the bloc at the end of next month, come what may.
Many in Brussels doubt his sincerity and argue that, since Johnson has lost his House of Commons majority and failed to convince the UK parliament to back a snap election, he may not be able to get any deal past his own MPs.
Johnson nevertheless says progress is being made but, asked whether this is true, Green MEP Philippe Lamberts, a member of the Brexit steering committee, said: “No, it’s not my sense but I guess he has to say that.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-port-company-high-court-brexit-4759745-Aug2019/,"DUBLIN PORT COMPANY has settled High Court proceedings it brought over a transport and warehousing firm’s failure to vacate a site needed to deal with the impact of Brexit.
The state-owned DPC had sought orders against McQuaid O’Flanagan Warehousing and Transport Ltd and one of its directors, Gerald McQuaid, including one to seize the company’s property, over a failure to comply with a court order.
At the High Court on Friday, McQuaid, as part of an agreement to resolve the dispute, gave a sworn undertaking before Justice Teresa Pilkington that the firm would vacate the site by 11 September next.
DPC had brought the proceedings over fears a standstill of truck traffic in the immediate aftermath of Brexit if its plans are hampered or delayed.
Earlier this year DPC had took an action in the Commercial Court against a number of parties aimed at securing possession of a site at Tolka Quay, which is located about 600m south of the Port Tunnel.
DPC intends to use the site as one of its truck parks and customs, immigration, agricultural inspection posts after Brexit.
The property had been mainly occupied by McQuaid O’Flanagan which had a lease with the former owners of the site.
DPC bought the site in January from the former owners and said McQuaid O’Flanagan’s lease on 3.7-hectare site expired last November.

DPC had sought various orders against a number of parties that had been on the site, including one preventing McQuaid O’Flanagan trespassing or otherwise interfering with its right to take possession.
Those proceedings were resolved on consent in March. As part of that agreement, Justice Robert Haughton made an order requiring the defendant company to vacate the property in tranches.
The site was to be fully vacated by McQuaid O’Flannagan by the end of July. However, DPC claimed that the defendant company had failed to comply with the order.
As a result of the defendant’s alleged breach, DPC sought orders appointing a receiver to sequester the property of both McQuaid O’Flanagan and of one of its directors Gerald McQuaid who DPC claimed were in contempt of court.
It also sought an order for McQuaid’s attachment and possible committal to prison.When the case returned before Justice Pilkington the court was told that following discussions the parties had reached an agreement.
As part of that agreement, McQuaid gave undertakings that the site would be fully vacated by 11 September next.
It was also agreed that in advance of that date the defendants would provide DPC with whatever access it needs to the site.
The judge congratulated the parties on reaching an agreement and informed McQuiad of the serious consequences of breaching the undertakings.
The matter will be mentioned before the courts on dates in August and September.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-mail-consumer-rights-4782870-Aug2019/,"AN POST HAS told customers “not to worry” about its preparations for a no-deal Brexit, saying “it’s not a big deal” as it has procedures in place for checking parcels from non-EU countries – although that volume is set to increase dramatically after Brexit.
The government and the consumer regulator here, however, called for consumers to be aware that their consumer rights and online pricing could change dramatically after Brexit, and to check British retailers’ terms and conditions before purchasing items.
Ireland receives 14 million parcels from the UK a year, and 10 million parcels from non-EU countries – meaning items that An Post has to check customs and duties on will more than double after Brexit.
During a visit by Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee to Portlaoise Mail Centre today, An Post’s Managing Director Garret Bridgeman said that the centre would be the first point where UK parcels would be examined, in an effort to avoid the expected delays at ports.
He said An Post has been working with the Royal Mail for the past year to prepare for Brexit. In three sites in Ireland that have customs officers – Portlaoise, Athlone, and Dublin – additional staff has been provided to prepare for a no-deal.
For the Dublin site, €15 million has been provided for an automated parcel machine which will be ready by the end of October – in time for the latest Brexit deadline.
Although Bridgeman said there would be no postage hikes from An Post, if there’s a no-deal Brexit there will be additional costs for customs and excise on parcels being sent from the UK (as if the product is being sent from the US).
Bridgeman said that An Post’s parcel volume doubles or trebles at Christmas, so they are prepared for an increase in checks on parcels, but there are other issues such as the recent dramatic drop in sterling which may influence online purchases from Ireland further than expected.
“Brexit has no impact on letters, just on parcels,” he said.
In six months’ time, An Post said it will launch a text service that will allow customers to pay for customs on items coming from non-EU countries by email or text.

Since the incident in March where an explosive parcel was sent from Ireland to London, An Post said it has “put in place additional procedures and purchased new equipment to make sure we have even better controls” than have already been in place ahead of a feared increase in violence in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Ireland’s consumer regulator has also warned people to start looking now at what their consumer rights are with retailers in the UK. If the UK leaves without a deal, Irish shoppers buying from British stores won’t be protected by the EU’s consumer laws.
The legal footing for consumer rights will revert from a statutory basis to the terms and conditions of the British company from which an item is being bought.
Fergal O’Leary of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission said today that an information campaign would begin in the coming weeks to prepare customers for the shift in those rights.
“So it is important to prepare now for the possibility that following Brexit there will be changes to your rights if you are buying online from a UK based retailer.”
When you buy from a business outside the EU,the CCPC explained before, you pay VAT if the value of the items plus shippingis €22 or more. VAT must be paid on imported items at the same rate that applies in Ireland for similar goods.
You also legally have to pay import charges such as customs or excise duties on items you buy from non-EU countriesworth €150 or more.

Minister McEntee was also asked for her reaction to a proposal by former Europe Minister Lucinda Creighton at the weekend, that the backstop should be limited to five years.
“A backstop with a time limit ceases to be a backstop,” she said, sticking to the long-touted Irish government and EU line.
She also disagreed that the Withdrawal Agreement was dead, but said that the Irish government’s default core position for preparations had been a no-deal Brexit “for some time”. She said she welcomed new Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s meetings with EU leaders, but said that it was still up to the UK to ratify the thrice-rejected Withdrawal Agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tony-connelly-boris-johnson-eu-4807448-Sep2019/,"HOW DO YOU explain the Brexit backstop or checks on the border in a three-minute broadcast?
The intertwined global economy, the gentle diplomatic ties between previously warring European states, and the complexities of EU bureaucracy were enough of a mouthful without piling on the never-ending, constantly unfolding Brexit drama.
Tony Connelly has been RTÉ’s Europe Editor since 2011, but has built up a Europe-wide profile in the past three years with his authoritative and impeccably-sourced Brexit briefings.
He’s broken Brexit stories internationally much to the ire of some, who argued that British journalists should be briefed or leaked to first – and that leaking to the Irish was another slight by the EU against the UK.

In an interview withTheJournal.ie, we asked about what the UK was like as a participant in the EU before it voted to leave, the strain the Brexit vote has put on Anglo-Irish relations, and how Boris Johnson’s journalistic career contributed to the UK’s swelling Eurosceptic views over decades.
Boris back in the day
Before the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, it had gone through several decades of debate on how it would fit into the ‘European movement’.
When the UK and Ireland joined the EU-precursor, the European Economic Communities (EEC) on 1 January 1973, it did so without asking its population first – and only held a referendum on the issue after, which it won bya two-thirds majority.
In the run up to that referendum, the Tory and Labour parties were split on whether they should work without or within the European collaboration, with Labour out-right opposing the EEC membership.But as a member of the EU, the UK was an active, energetic participant, Tony Connelly says.“The UK was seen to have a very professional civil service, that was not as political as those in other European countries. Officials would write up very detailed dossiers, and the Irish government appreciated those efforts,” Connelly says.
AVoteWatchanalysis of European Parliament votes indicated that of the votes that the UK took part in, Britain was the country that was on the losing side of votes the most – but it was on the winning side in 92% of votes, which indicates an active member state, but also, perhaps, an increasingly frustrated one.
A decade after the UK joined the European Union, Boris Johnson had started as The Daily Telegraph’s Brussels correspondent, writing articles that have been credited with  strongly influencing the growing Eurosceptic sentiment at the time.
“It was Boris Johnson’s ‘style of reporting’ in the Telegraph that started it,” Connelly says, “but other British tabloids started to copy it – portraying the EU as this caricatured, overbearing enforcer.”
He also mentionsan academic studythat found the reason why there was a Remain vote in Liverpool was because of the boycott of The Sun (which happened after their coverage of the Hillsborough disaster), and that had a direct impact on the way people voted.
In the 2016 Brexit referendum, 58% of people in Liverpool and 51% in Merseyside backed staying in the EU. Authors argued that the vote on Merseyside would have been about 60% in favour of Leave without the boycott of The Sun.

Anglo-Irish relations
As a result of Brexit – and notwithstanding the recent “constructive” meeting betweenJohnson and Varadkar in Dublin– relations between Ireland and the UK have deteriorated.
“In Europe,” Connelly says, “there’s been a steady retreat from the Brits – they’re not contributing the way they used to, they’ve said they’ll stop sending officials over.”
“At the beginning, there was a worry that the UK would try to peel Ireland off,” he adds – there have been numerous reports of the British cabinet and officials briefing against Ireland in other European capitals which “wouldn’t be forgotten easily” in Dublin.
Added to this is the “deepening lack of trust” after the UK reneged on the promises that were made in the 2017 Joint Report that lead to the “weatherproof” Irish backstop – which was ultimately aimed at preserving peace in Northern Ireland.
Understanding the EU
Since the Brexit referendum, EU officials have been working to inform the citizens of member states about how the EU works, and the various goals and objectives it has.
Some MEPs have accused journalists of ignoring EU issues, and as a result people don’t know what’s happening in Europe and disengage from its work. Does Connelly feel that is fair, or is it that people don’t have an interest in the EU, so journalists tend not to cover it?
“There are a number of problems. One is, the way the EU operates is it covers 27 or 28 countries and the way in which those countries agree to new legislation is complex.
“The decision making process is difficult to understand, and it might take 18 months for legislation to be processed and become law. So at what stage do you cover that legislation?
“Ironically Brexit has heightened awareness of all of this. In the normal run of events, EU process happens under the radar, they all work away on files and follow procedure…
So what are the challenges of broadcasting Brexit, when you have to relay complicated political procedures, various industries and how they are connected to one another, and not a lot of time to instantly understand – or factcheck – what you’re reporting on?
“During the referendum, there were lots of claims made in the UK that were clearly unfounded, and presenters on news programmes repeated them, especially on the BBC. They didn’t know the ins and outs, and weren’t able to check the claims being made.
Connelly says that it’s “challenging” to know it all, but aims to know as much of the detail as is important, and to know it accurately.
You might have a night like when the 585-page-long Withdrawal Agreement was released – an international treaty with lengthy protocols, articles, and treaties written in legalese – and Connelly might be going on the Nine O’Clock News 20 minutes later to explain it.
“I can’t expect to pronounce it chapter and verse, so you might say we’ve just gotten this and we are going through it. Then you’d call your contacts and ask ‘What does this protocol mean? Where do we find the bit about the backstop?’ You have to have a huge bank of your own notes to rely on.”
So – while, we’re here –what’s next?
“The Northern Ireland only backstop is a possible landing zone for Boris Johnson,” Connelly says. “If he’s sticking to his promise to leave the EU by 31 October, his choice is to do a deal or to break the law. So he’s got very few options.”
“If there’s some way to make the backstop less ‘anti-democratic’, that might be a way to get Boris Johnson to climb down from his tree.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/rees-mogg-brexit-deal-positive-4849526-Oct2019/,"LAST UPDATE|13 Oct 2019
THE EUROPEAN UNION’S chief Brexit negotiator has warned that ”a lot of work remains to be done” in withdrawal talks between London and Brussels.
The European Commission issued a statement shortly after Michel Barnier briefed EU ambassadors on the negotiations, just four days before a key European summit.
“Michel Barnier briefed EU27 ambassadors this afternoon, following constructive technical-level talks with the United Kingdom over the weekend,” it said.
“He will also inform the European Parliament’s Brexit Steering Group this evening. A lot of work remains to be done,” it warned.
Downing Street said Boris Johnson also told his cabinet to brace for a cliff-hanger finish.
He reiterated “that a pathway to a deal could be seen but that there is still a significant amount of work to get there and we must remain prepared to leave on 31 October,” a Downing Street spokesman said.
A European diplomat familiar with today’s briefing confirmed that there had not been any sign of a quick resolution to the crisis, and suggested Britain’s position had not moved far enough.
“No breakthrough yet. Intensive discussions continue. Overall not an easy starting position — also because only a few days remain until the European Council,” the source said.
“If the British government wants a solution, it must move quickly now. The clock is ticking.”
‘Eat my words’
Earlier, Jacobs Rees- Mogg issued an appeal to Brexiteers to trust Boris Johnson as negotiations on a deal with Brussels enter a critical stage.
The Leader of the Commons, who was a thorn in the side of Theresa May over Brexit before joining Johnson’s administration, warned compromise was inevitable if there was to be an agreement.

He hinted he may even have to “eat my words” and support a plan close to one put forward by May which he described as “completely cretinous”.
Rees-Mogg – who previously led the strongly pro-Brexit European Research Group – insisted however Leave supporters could have confidence Johnson would not give too much ground to Brussels in order to get a deal.
“I think that he is somebody who even the arch Eurosceptics, even a member of the Brexit Party, can trust and have confidence in,” he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme.
His comments will be seen as a sign of nervousness that hardline Tory Brexiteers could scupper any agreement Johnson is able to reach, just as they thwarted his predecessor.

In a conference call with Cabinet ministers to brief them on the negotiations, Johnson said that while he could see a “pathway” to a deal there was still a “significant amount of work” to be done.
“The Prime Minister said there was a way forward for a deal that could secure all our interests, respect the Good Friday Agreement, get rid of the backstop and get Brexit done by 31 October,” a No 10 spokesman said.
It comes after the DUP deputy leader Nigel Doddsfired a warning shotto ministers that any return to May’s plan to resolve the issue of the Irish border would not be acceptable to his party.
Reports from Brussels suggested the Prime Minister had sought to revive a proposal by May for Northern Ireland to remain politically in a customs union with the EU, but it would be administered by the UK.
The plan would avoid the need for customs controls on the island of Ireland – something the EU is adamantly opposed to.
However, Dodds – whose party’s votes may be essential if a deal is to get through Parliament – told the Italian La Repubblica newspaper that Northern Ireland “must stay in a full UK customs union, full stop”.
“It cannot work because Northern Ireland has to remain fully part of the UK customs union,” he said.
Rees-Mogg refused to be drawn on the detail of what was being discussed in the Belgian capital.

“Naturally in the middle of a negotiation these matters are extremely sensitive as everyone is compromising to some degree and therefore to give negotiations the best chance of succeeding, it is best to be discreet about them,” he said.
But pressed on whether it could be close to May’s plan, he said:
He added: “There’s a line from Churchill saying that he often had to eat his words and he found it to be a very nourishing diet – and that is something that happens in politics.”

Meanwhile, Home Secretary Priti Patel said security measures were being stepped up in preparedness for a possible no-deal, but denied they were driven by fears of an upsurge in terrorism by dissident Irish republicans.
She acknowledged, however, they were “conscious” of the situation in Northern Ireland and said ministers were working on “alternative arrangements” for intelligence and data sharing.
“When it comes to security tools and security co-operation there are many measures that are being put in place right now in preparedness for no-deal,” she told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the party would decide how to respond once they had seen any deal Johnson was able to bring back from Brussels.
However, he urged “caution” on any MPs considering backing an agreement if it were put to a confirmatory referendum.
“I think many in Parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others might be more inclined to support it even if they don’t really agree with the deal. But I would caution them,” he told Sophy Ridge on Sunday.

https://www.thejournal.ie/economy-brexit-4721430-Jul2019/,"THE UK CRASHING out of the EU is one of the main risks facing the Irish economy, with a hard Brexit having the potential to the cause house prices to fall, the Central Bank has warned.
In its first Financial Stability Review, published yesterday, the Central Bank warned that external events were the main risks facing the Irish economy.
These include a “disorderly” Brexit – with the UK crashing out of the EU – an abrupt tightening of global financial conditions, or the reemergence of sovereign debt sustainability concerns in the euro.
The report warns that a negative shock to the Irish economy – from Brexit or “some other unforeseen geopolitical event” – has the potential to cause house prices to fall.
“Income falls due to such a shock would affect demand for housing,” the report states.
The Financial Stability Review outlines the risks facing the financial system in Ireland and the resilience of the economy to withstand adverse shocks.

Among the other risks, an abrupt fall in Irish property prices and the possibility of more risk-taking behaviour in the banking sector are listed as potential problems.
Preparing for Brexit
The Central Bank said that it has taken action to mitigate some of the most immediate risks to financial services between the EU and UK in the event of a hard Brexit.
“The main outstanding source of risk to financial stability and the wider economy is a larger-than-expected macroeconomic shock in a disorderly Brexit,” it states.
Acting Governor of the bank – Sharon Donnery – said that, as a small and highly globalised economy, with a reliance of foreign multinational companies, “Ireland is both more sensitive to developments in the global cycle and more prone to structural macroeconomic shocks”.
“It is critical that we continue to identify, plan and prepare to mitigate the impact of those shocks, should they materialise,” she said.
“Building a resilient system is central to this. Resilience is not something that can be built after an event, but is something that should be in place well before any issues arise.

https://www.thejournal.ie/budget-2020-discussions-carbon-tax-4802720-Sep2019/,"AS BUDGET TALKS commence today between Fianna Fáil and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, Micheál Martin says a carbon tax and further health service investment should be pushed.
Speaking this morning, Martin said said a climate change dimension will be necessary in the 2020 Budget along with improving access to healthcare services.
The Cork TD said there would “need to be” a carbon tax in the upcoming Budget. No such tax was brought in as part of last year’s Budget.
Parties have been preparing their policies lately before the new political season begins  in the Dáil later this month.
“For us, prioritisation has to be in investment in services. The health service is imploding at the front line,” Martin said onRTÉ’s Morning Irelandtoday.
Martin added that “there would have to be a climate change dimension to the Budget” for 2020.
“We believe there has to be [a carbon tax],” he said.
A €10 increase in carbon tax has been the figure used since last year. Donohoeincluded a notein pre-budget submissions last year saying he was “currently minded” to implement a €10 increase on Budget day.
Martin said today that this ”could be less than 10, it could be five or six euro”.
Speaking toTheJournal.ielast year,Taoiseach Leo Varadkarsaid that implementing a carbon tax last year would have “hit people with a double whammy” and wiped out any benefits people received through tax cuts elsewhere.

“It will mean an increase certainly in certain fuel costs but in our view, the overwhelming evidence has been… that we have to start dealing and making fossil fuels in particular over time a less attractive to people,” he added.
The money gained from the carbon tax should be “ringfenced into a separate fund” used for activities on climate change and biodiversity, said Martin.
“We will be setting goals… but ultimately the government has to deliver,” he said.
2020 general election?
In terms of an election, the party leader said it will likely take place next year. Martin added that he believes it was the right decision to not hold a general election earlier, mainly due to Brexit uncertainty.
“There can’t be an election if the prospect of a no-deal is there on the horizons,” he said.
“Our preference is to be the lead party in a government with smaller parties… I think there will be a fragmented Dáil in the next election”, Martin said, adding that the ‘two-party system’ of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is “gone”.
Martin said there will need to be an emphasis on the provision and investment of services in the 2020 Budget. He said access to health services can be “very difficult for too many people”.
Services such as home help and home care packages and the fair deal should also be focused on in terms of investment.
“We are frustrated by the failure of government in health and Brexit and other areas,” he said.
“Our priority is to make sure there is sufficient service to make sure people can get access to healthcare services.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/over-half-a-million-people-have-applied-for-irish-passports-so-far-this-year-4688407-Jun2019/,"MORE THAN 533,600 applications for Irish passports have been received so far this year.
There has been unprecedented demand for Irish passports in 2019, with the Passport Office receiving more than 100,000 applications each month.
March was the peak with 112,900 –the highest month on record.
While the Passport Office has said in the past that there are a number of reasons for the increase in demand, including a tendency towards early renewal and an increase in the number of Irish people travelling, Brexit is also playing a key role in the numbers boost.
“Since recording of passport numbers began there were only two months on record where the number of applications topped one-hundred thousand in a month. Contrast that with every month in 2019 when we’ve received at least one-hundred thousand applications, that’s how busy it is,” said a government source.
Demand from the UK and Northern Ireland continues to be up significantly on last year.
“Extreme peaks in demand from the UK and Northern Ireland were seen in February and March. The numbers are remaining high every month but those peaks were definitely seen in the context of Brexit,” they added.

It is understood that 45% of all applications are now being received through the online portal.
“This is an essential change in behaviour, the system would be crippled if all of these applications were coming in on paper. We are seeing people migrate to online renewal of their passport and we are getting great feedback on the speed passports are being issued through the online system dfa.ie/passports.”
Of adult and child applications, 99% of correctly completed online renewals are sent out within 10 working days. 40% of correctly completed online adult applications are sent out within 3 working days.
“The fastest way to get your passport renewed is online, it’s light years faster than contacting a TD,” said the government source.
Last week (10 June – 17 June) saw 5311 customer service calls and 4,111 live web chats with those seeking a passport – the highest number since the system began.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is calling on those booking holidays or due to travel in July, August and September to check that their passports are in date.
“Every year we see cases of families with one passport out of date, usually for one of the children, and they usually realise in the airport or the night before a flight,” said a department spokesperson.
“This can cost thousands to rebook a family holiday, it will only take five minutes to take the passports out and make sure everyone’s documents are in date.”
The passport offices in Dublin, Balbriggan and Cork have received more than 300 extra staff this year to keep up with demand.

IntertradeIreland’s (ITI) all-Island business monitor, published today, shows that 40% of companies around the country have reported growth for the three months to the end of June but few are optimistic about the next 12 months, citing Brexit as the biggest cause of this uncertain outlook.
The survey found that 45% of businesses overall, and almost 60% of manufacturing firms, record Brexit as the key issue they face.
“Worryingly, however, despite a range of support services, only 11% of respondents say they have made any preparations in the event of a ‘no-deal ’ Brexit,” ITI said.
The cross-border body said that larger firms are better prepared for the UK crashing out of the bloc as 35% of these businesses have made preparations so far.
However, ITI found only 1 in 10 micro businesses have made any preparations.

Aidan Gough, ITI’s director of strategy and policy, said the disparity between businesses recognising Brexit as the key issue facing them and the number actually preparing for it “remains a worry”.
ITI says 82% of cross-border traders, who are most exposed in the event of a no-deal, have not prepared for that outcome. Only 14% of businesses trading cross-border have examined the impact of customs, while just 12% have looked at the effect of tariffs.
“Don’t leave it until the last minute. There are lots of small steps that businesses can begin to take now to prepare, whatever the outcome. It doesn’t have to be onerous. Planning is never wasted and is much preferable to panic if left undone,” Gough said.
UK urges EU to reflect ‘political reality’

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government urged EU leaders again to drop their opposition to renegotiating the terms of Brexit, claiming recent European elections required a change of approach.
Johnson, who took office late last month, says he wants to leave the European Union with a deal but insists the current terms are unacceptable and if necessary Britain will exit on 31 October with no agreement at all.
In an article in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, Johnson’s Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said European Parliament elections in May had changed the political dynamic and urged EU leaders to amend the mandate of their chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.
“The political realities have changed since Mr Barnier’s instructions were set,” Barclay wrote.
Related Reads'Panic' and 'security gaps': Internal British document warns about impact of no-deal Brexit
“Since the last mandate was agreed, 61% of all the EU states’ MEPs have changed. Such a fundamental shift illustrates the need for a change of approach.
“Mr Barnier needs to urge EU leaders to consider this if they too want an agreement, to enable him to negotiate in a way that finds common ground with the UK.
Former prime minister Theresa May quit after delaying Brexit twice while she tried unsuccessfully to get the divorce terms she struck with Brussels through the British parliament.
But the EU has refused to reopen the deal, the result of 17 months of tough negotiations.
Johnson has ramped up preparations for leaving without any agreement, however, an internal British government document warned that a no-deal Brexit could result in “consumer panic”, “security gaps” and “law and order challenges”.
Some British lawmakers have vowed to stop Johnson, fearing the economic consequences of severing ties with Britain’s closest trading partner overnight.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-government-debt-set-to-rocket-in-event-of-no-deal-brexit-think-tank-warns-4841545-Oct2019/,"UK GOVERNMENT DEBT is set to rocket to levels not seen since the 1960s in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a leading economic think tank has warned.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said following last month’s spending review, Government borrowing was on course to top £50 billion (€55 billion) next year, more than double what the Office for Budget Responsibility was forecasting as recently as March.
However, in the event of even a “relatively benign” no-deal Brexit, the IFS said that could rise to almost £100 billion – while debt would climb to almost 90% of national income for the first time since the mid-1960s.
In its annual “green budget”, the IFS warned that in those circumstances, next year’s “mini boom” in public spending would be followed by another “bust” as ministers tried to get the public finances under control.
Analysis by Citi bank for the IFS calculated UK national income was already between £55 billion and £66 billion lower than it would have been if the country had voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum.
As a result, Britain had missed out “almost entirely” on the bout in global growth of the last three years.
It warned that a no-deal Brexit was likely to mean two years of zero growth – even with a “substantial” fiscal and monetary response by the Government and the Bank of England.
Even when it returned to growth, it would remain weak at just 1.1%, leaving the economy 2.5% smaller than it would have been.
Citi said that leaving the EU with a Brexit deal should see the economy continuing to grow, albeit weakly at around 1.5% a year.
However further delay to Brexit would mean continued economic uncertainty with “very poor” growth of around just 1% a year.

‘Fischal anchor’
Overall, Citi, said that remaining in the EU would be the best outcome for economic growth.
However, if this happened under a Labour government committed to carrying out its policies on tax, nationalisation, share ownership and labour policy regulation, it was impossible to say whether the net effect would be better or worse than leaving the EU with a more “growth-friendly” set of policies.
The IFS said ministers had now effectively abandoned former chancellor Philip Hammond’s tax and spending rules, including his manifesto commitment to balance the budget by the mid 2020s.
It said the Government’s day-to-day spending plans for public services were now close to the levels implied by Labour’s 2017 election manifesto, and far higher than those in the Conservative manifesto.
IFS director Paul Johnson, said the figures meant Chancellor Sajid Javid can’t afford any big tax giveaways when he comes to deliver his first budget.
He said that in the event of no-deal, any measures to support the economy would have to be strictly temporary.
“The Government is now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor,” he said.
“Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways in any forthcoming budget.
“In the case of a no-deal Brexit, though, it should be implementing carefully targeted and temporary tax cuts and spending increases where it can effectively support the economy.
“It will be crucial that these programmes are temporary: an economy that turns out smaller than expected can, in the long run, support less public spending than expected, not more.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-retailers-4793440-Sep2019/,"A GROUP REPRESENTING Irish retailers are set to have meetings with MPs in the UK in the coming days amid fears of the effects that a no-deal Brexit would have on them.
Retail Excellence Ireland has also asked the government if it would consider seconding a staff member from Revenue with experience in customs and certification for the next four months to help its members deal with Brexit.
It was another tumultuous few days in Westminster this week, with the House of Commons voting to try block a no-deal Brexit and Boris Johnson trying and failing to call a general election.
With Johnson repeating again and again the UK would be leaving the EU come what may on 31 October, the threat of a no-deal has remained high.

Late last month, Retail Excellence Ireland group chief executive David Fitzsimons wrote to both Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Business Heather Humphreys.
He said: “I am writing out of concern regarding the negative impact of Brexit on the Irish retail industry.
Fitzsimons said that over 2,000 retail community members and the wider industry is “inadequately prepared for Brexit”.
“Add to this the negative impact Brexit will have on consumer sentiment and spending, the outlook is bleak,” he said.
The retail group head included in his letter a request from Ministers Donohoe and Humphreys to consider seconding a member of the team from Revenue from September to December.

THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT has announced a three-year immigration scheme for most European citizens coming to the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The move put forward earlier today was aimed at reassuring businesses that they will still be able to recruit staff from other countries.
The new policy will allow immigrants and their close family members from the European Economic Area (EEA) – which is comprised of EU nations, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway – and Switzerland to apply to live and work in the UK for up to three years.
The British interior ministry has said the move signalled “the end of free movement in its current form” from EEA member states. It will run until the end of 2020
“Citizens of those states moving to the UK after we have left the EU and up until the end of 2020 will be able to obtain a temporary immigration status lasting three years,” it said in a statement.
“This will give businesses certainty that they will be able to recruit and retain staff after Brexit.”

The ministry said Europeans could still visit the UK on short trips after Brexit without applying for the scheme.
It added “a tougher criminality threshold” would also be applied post-Brexit for Europeans citizens “in order to keep out and deport those who commit crimes”.
Applications for new three-year stays, which will open after Britain has left the EU, will involve “a simple online process” involving identity, security and criminality checks, according to the interior ministry.
Newly-arrived European citizens who want to stay after their temporary status expires will need to apply under a new skills-based immigration system that Johnson’s government is planning, it said.
“Introducing tougher checks and ending free movement as it currently stands will allow us to take the first, historic steps towards taking back control of our borders,” interior minister Priti Patel said.
“In the future, we will introduce a new points-based immigration system built around the skills and talent people have – not where they are from.”
EU Citizens already living in the UK before Brexit can remain indefinitely under a separate settled status scheme which has already been launched.
More than one million people had been granted status through the scheme, according to the ministry.","9.05pm, 4 Sep 2019",

Attorney General Geoffrey Cox opened the launch of Johnson’s campaign, a surprise new backer to Johnson’s 70-plus strong list of supporters.
In his speech, he spoke about representing “every region” by improving transport and broadband, praised the British economy, saying that they were reaching “Grand-Prix speeds but without firing on all cylinders” – and said he didn’t want a no-deal Brexit.
At the beginning of his speech, he told the packed room of media and supporters that the British economy was almost “neck-and-neck with Germany’s”.
He said he would advocate for a “sensible orderly Brexit that allows us to build a new partnership with our friends across the channel.
“We can still have a fantastic, intense relationship” with EU countries, he said, while also buoying a sense of English pride:
He also said that he believed in “synergy” between free markets and public services, adding that he would “stick up for every business in this country”.

He also said that although he wouldn’t delay Brexit past October and that he wouldn’t rule out a no-deal Brexit – that he didn’t want to leave the EU without a deal.

“Parties have entered a yellow-box junction where they cannot move forward or back.
“After three years, and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on October 31st,” he said, sparking applause from the audience.
“I don’t think we will end up with any such thing,” adding that it was “astonishing” that British negotiators had ruled it out up to now.
“Delay means defeat, delay means Corbyn,” he added. “Kick the can – and we kick the bucket!”
When asked if he was inconsistent on whether he wanted a no-deal Brexit or not, Johnson answered:
“If we make the preparations now, that we are able to make that exit, if we have to which of course would be a last resort. The best way to avoid it is to prepare for it.”

When Johnson was asked whether he regretted some of his more controversial views – his comparison of Muslim women to post-boxes was specifically mentioned – Johnson said he would continue to speak as he has, even if “plaster comes off the roof”.
“To those who seem to caricature my views… it’s vital that we remember that one of the reasons why the public [feel distant from politicians] is they feel we are muffling and veiling our language, and covering everything up in bureaucratic platitudes.
“If I use phrases and language that cause offence, I’m sorry for causing offence but I will continue to speak as directly I can.”
Johnson was also asked whether he had taken cocaine before, but didn’t answered the question, and talked about what the public wants from the Tory party instead.

Donohoe said Javid is “absolutely committed” to Britain leaving the European Union by the current deadline of 31 October.
He said he told Javid that the Irish government remains committed to thebackstop elementof the Withdrawal Agreement, describing it as “the best possible insurance policy for all of the risks that we may need to deal with in the future”.
Many Conservative and DUP politicians have raised concerns about the backstop, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules post-Brexit.
Donohoe said the backstop is vital for trade and the stability of the peace process. He reiterated these comments when speaking to British media.

He added that the Irish government is making preparations for the potential consequence of a no-deal Brexit in terms of trade, border checks and the peace process.
“We will want to mitigate any of the consequences of this, but of course this is the very reason why we want a backstop agreement in place in the first instance.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/emma-desouza-verdict-4850911-Oct2019/,"Emma DeSouza and her US born husband Jake arrive for a press conference in West Belfast yesterday.Niall CarsonNiall Carson
YESTERDAY, THE UK’S Upper Tribunal ruled that people born in Northern Ireland cannot, as a matter of law, self-identify as an Irish citizen only without revoking their British citizenship.
Essentially, people born in Northern Ireland are automatically British citizens unless they choose to renounce it, which requires a formal process with a fee of £200 attached, the judges found.
This overturned a decision made by the First-Tier Tribunal that found that immigration laws as laid out in the British Nationality Act 1981 were superseded by the Good Friday Agreement. The Home Office had argued that an international treaty didn’t overpower British immigration law, and won.
For those in Northern Ireland who wish to identify as Irish only, they must revoke their British citizenship.
This, according to many commentators and politicians, contravenes the Good Friday Agreement, which claims in Article 1 (iv)/(vi) to recognise “the birthright of all the people of Northern Irelandto identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland”.
Tánaiste Simon Coveneyis to askNorthern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith to follow-up on former Prime Minister Theresa May’s pledge to “review the issues around citizenship urgently to deliver a long-term solution consistent with the letter and spirit” of the Good Friday Agreement.
So, what arethe reasons given for that conclusionby the tribunal, given the reaction from those in Northern Ireland and the Irish government?
Some parts of the Good Friday Agreement aren’t legally binding.The ruling said that even if the “legal significance” of the Good Friday Agreement giving citizens the power to self-identify as British or Irish or both is taken into account, as the DeSouzas claimed, “its existence in an international treaty, whilst binding in international law, does not thereby make it binding under the domestic law of the United Kingdom”.

This is the core argument made by the Home Office – domestic law supersedes an international treaty.
Upper TribunalUpper Tribunal
The Upper Tribunal gives a reasoning for this, too – that it’s not in the power of any one British government to take or give rights to its citizens without the approval of the UK parliament. The decision quotes a previous hearing:
The ruling continues: “it would infringe parliamentary sovereignty if, by entering into a treaty with a foreign state, the executive branch could thereby change the domestic law of the United Kingdom without recourse to parliament”.
As we have seen very recently in the UK through functions like indicative votes and the prorogation of parliament, the role of the House of Commons in the democratic process is held in high regard.
Upper TribunalUpper Tribunal
Statelessness.The argument the Home Office made is that Northern Irish citizens can identify as British or Irish, or both, but that does not make them legal citizens of their choosing.
The reasons for this are complex, but for example, if the argument is that the British government is imposing British citizenship on Emma DeSouza and others, then by the same token, the Irish government cannot impose Irish citizenship on those born in the North either.
“The result is that a person born in Northern Ireland is born stateless,” the Upper Tribunal concluded, saying that this would be a breach of both countries’ international obligations to prevent statelessness.
Upper TribunalUpper Tribunal
Consent.The DeSouzas had argued that the British Nationality Act didn’t need to be amended to be seen as compatible in order to comply with the Good Friday Agreement, which the Upper Tribunal said was “not a submission that can find favour”.
Related ReadsCourt case begins on whether the North's citizens can self-identify as IrishDerry woman in wrangle with UK Home Office fears Brexit could complicate her immigration case
In order for the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement to be taken into account, the phrase “if they consent to identify as such” should be inserted in front of “British citizen”.
“Even assuming that this amendment would apply only to those born in Northern Ireland, it would represent a radical departure from the existing law of British nationality,” the Upper Tribunal found.
Upper TribunalUpper Tribunal
This raised “a host of difficult issues” among them the issue of consent.
If and when a person does, it continued, it raises questions as to “whether, and, if so, how, such a person could be expected to signify consent”.
Conclusion.The Upper Tribunal also said that the webpage on the Northern Ireland Administration that says “people born in Northern Ireland can choose to be British citizens, Irish citizens or both” is not an authoritative source of law, and “must be regarded as wrong”.
It also said that “as a matter of law Mrs DeSouza is, at present, a British citizen at the current time”.

In one of its final paragraph, it concluded that it was “important” to state:

https://www.thejournal.ie/richard-tice-leo-varadkar-hijacked-backstop-4819756-Sep2019/,"THE CHAIRMAN OF the Brexit Party has accused Taoiseach Leo Varadkar of “hijacking” the backstop issue, and claimed that the amount of trade that crosses the Northern Irish border is “irrelevant” and “it wouldn’t matter”.
Speaking toTheJournal.ieat a Brexit Party conference event in Newport, chairman and MEP Richard Tice said that “too many of the UK politicians have used the backstop issue, the Irish border issue, basically as a way of making it all so complicated and difficult”.
After dismissing the trade across the Irish border as “tiny” and “irrelevant” in comparison to the EU’s total trade, the 55-year-old businessman said that security along the border wouldn’t be a concern.
“The truth is that people like Leo Varadkar have disgracefully hijacked this issue,” Tice said.
The Brexit Party is on a conference tour of the UK for the month of September, stopping off in a number of areas before a final event in London. On Saturday,the Brexit Party was at Newport, Waleswhere around 300-400 people attended the event.
During the event, Tice illustrated for the crowd how the Withdrawal Agreement was a bad deal. While holding handcuffs, Tice said that under the Withdrawal Agreement, the UK would be tied to the EU in a way that would be the same as imprisonment.

The jar of Smarties
While speaking toTheJournal.ie, Tice used another illustrative example to make his point that trade across the Irish border wouldn’t be an issue.
“I’ll give you a simple picture to understand the issue here. If you put 1,000 Smarties into a glass jar, those Smarties represent all of the trade that goes on across borders in the whole of the European Union. How many Smarties do you think, represent the amount of trade that goes across that border of Northern Ireland?”
He said that the technology that has been proposed to replace the backstop “is no different” to the technology used to track a parcel being delivered to your home on your app: “It’s exactly the same technology.”
He continued:
“Yes, everybody knows, there is already smuggling that goes across that border. It’s tiny. It wouldn’t matter if one Smartie turned into two Smarties in terms of the protection of the Single Market or the Customs Union. It’s irrelevant.”
At the Newport event on Saturday, Brexit Party leader and high-profile Brexiteer Nigel Farage said that the Irish border/backstop question was “very difficult to provide an answer for”. He also said that there would be no hard border, because Leo Varadkar, the European Union, and the UK all said that there would be no hard border.
Yesterday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Junckertold Sky Newsthat there would be a border on the island of Ireland if there was no deal.
“An animal entering Northern Ireland without border control can enter the European Union without any kind of control via the southern part of the Irish island. This cannot happen. We have to preserve the health and safety of our citizens,” Juncker said.
Related ReadsAt the Brexit Party's Wales rally, Nigel Farage targets Labour and the backstop - but thinks Juncker is rather fun
Earlier this month, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar admitted for the first time that some checks may have to take place at the border if there’s a no-deal Brexit.
“There will be checks on goods and live animals and, as far as possible, they will take place in ports, airports and at businesses. But some may need to take place near the border.”
A surge for the Brexit Party
The Brexit Party won 29 MEP seats out of the UK’s 73 in the European Parliament, making them the UK’s largest political party in the EP. The most recent YouGov poll puts the party, which was formed just earlier this year, on 14%.
“Yes, there is a lot of anger out there, and people do feel betrayed,” Tice says, of the supporters of his party.
“And that’s what we’re standing for – we’re standing for to make sure that democracy is protected and upheld. Heaven forbid there was a second referendum, and if the result was Remain. Then people’s trust in democracy will disappear forever in this country.”
He said that if there was a second referendum, they would insist on the choice being between a ‘clean-break Brexit’ or Remain, and believes that Remain would win “absolutely hands down”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/beef-farmers-protest-4747521-Aug2019/,"Farmers protesting outside Leinster House in Dublin on 10 JulyLeah FarrellLeah Farrell
FARMERS ACROSS THE country have been holding protests in recent days to highlight their concerns over the beef sector in Ireland.
In recent months, Irish farmers have become increasingly concerned over the state of the beef sector.
This is due to a range of issues, including a new trade deal with South America, which farmers fear may threaten their livelihoods, and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
So, what protests have been taking place?
Yesterday, the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) national council and livestock committee held a demonstration at the EU Food and Veterinary Offices in Co Meath.
The IFA said it was protesting to “highlight the urgent need to support the Irish and European beef sectors, which are in crisis”.

On 10 July, thousands of farmers and their families took to the streets of Dublin to voice their anger.
This protest saw angry scenes outside Leinster House.
Roscommon TD Michael Fitzmaurice received a rapturous applause when he took to the stage to address farmers.
He said from 2010 to 2012 “when there were no Mercs to be sold and no homes to be built, the country relied on you as farmers. Now, when the country is starring to move they think they can shite down on top of you”.
“Today is the beginning, the beginning of the rural revival. Today we will stand up and there is more of this to come.
“We will not be walked over, rural Ireland will live. Say fuck off to Mercosur,” shouted Fitzmaurice.
TheIrish Farmers Journalreported over the weekend that the Beef Plan Movement had called on suckler and beef farmers to support a protest that would see farmers avoid numerous businesses last Monday, 29 July.
It reported that farmers were asked to:
Other protests have been taking place outside meat factories in recent days.
So, what exactly are these protests over?
There are a few reasons behind the protests.
In part, it comes down to a new trade agreement between the European Union and the bloc of South American countries known as Mercosur.
The agreement was reached after two decades of negotiations, and is expected to remove more than 90% of agricultural and industrial tariffs on both sides.
It could save European companies billions of Euro in trade duties every year, but not everyone is happy about it - a Government minister, opposition TDs, farming lobbyists and environmental groups have all criticised the deal.

The agreement will open up the 28-nation trading bloc to Mercosur, a four-nation group of South American countries made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
Farmers protesting over a range of issues including the proposed Mercosur trade dealLeah FarrellLeah Farrell
Under the agreement, Mercosur has pledged to eliminate taxes on wine, chocolate, spirits, biscuits, tinned peaches, carbonated drinks, and olives.
In return, the EU will open its markets to South American agricultural products – its biggest concession.
This will be done via a system of quotas: 99 tonnes of beef per year at a preferential rate of 7.5%, as well as a supplementary quota on 180,000 tonnes of sugar and another one on 100,000 tonnes of poultry.
The trade agreement has caused worry among the farming community, with many concerned over how the introduction of such a substantial increase in beef imports to the EU would affect Ireland’s agricultural sector.
What else are the farmers protesting over?
Irish farmers have a range of other concerns in relation to Ireland’s beef sector.
Looking at it from a financial perspective, at the current steer base price of €3.45/kg, Irish beef prices are down 45c/kg on last year or €160/head, according to the IFA.
Unsurprisingly, Brexit is also a significant concern for farmers in Ireland.
“The UK leaving the EU presents the most serious threat to Irish farming and our agri-food sector in the history of the State,” the IFA says on its website.
“The crisis in the beef sector is an EU-wide problem driven by Brexit uncertainty and falling consumption. This is compounded by substandard imports coming into the EU,” IFA president Joe Healy said yesterday.
“The situation is now intolerable for farmers and solutions must come from Brussels and the Irish government.”

Healy yesterday expressed concerns over beef from Brazil which is being imported into the EU market.
Brazil is the largest importer of beef into the EU market with 140,243 tonnes a year.
Healy said “that while farmers have rightly been outraged at the recent EU/Mercosur trade deal, which had yet to be ratified, the real scandal is that significant quantities of substandard beef from Brazil are already coming onto the EU market”.
“Beef is being produced in Brazil using substances and practices which are illegal in the EU. This is ‘unfair competition’ and it is damaging cattle prices and farm incomes, not only in Ireland but across the EU,” Healy claimed.
The IFA president went on to claim that:
The outrage over the importation of beef into the EU was the reasoning behind yesterday’s protest at the EU Food & Veterinary Offices.
What do the farmers’ want?
Well, there are a number of measures being sought by the IFA in relation to Ireland’s beef sector.
The IFA is calling for an immediate ban on all substandard South American beef imports.
It’s also calling for an EU campaign to promote Ireland’s environmentally sustainable EU beef production.

Agriculture Minister Michael Creed earlier this week announced details of the new Beef Exceptional Aid Measure.
This measure, which is worth €100 million, will be funded by  a combination of EU exceptional aid and Exchequer support.
The Department said it is being “provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers have been facing as a result of market volatility and uncertainty arising out of Brexit”.

IFA presidential candidate Tim Cullinan said the €100 million package will not be enough to cover the damage caused by Brexit.
“It is only the first instalment that will be needed to cover the losses that beef farmers are currently experiencing and the catastrophe that’s looming for the remainder of the year,” Cullinan said.
The IFA has called for a €1 billion Brexit fund of market supports and direct aid for farmers to be made available.
What have politicians said?
In relation to the trade deal, EU agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan among was those who recognised the challenges the deal presents.
“For this agreement to be a win-win… carefully managed quotas will ensure that there is no risk that any product will flood the EU market and thereby threaten the livelihood of EU farmers,” he said.
Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed called the agreement “very disappointing”.
The issue of the trade deal was also raised by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald during Leaders’ Questions on 10 July.
“You say that this deal needs to be assessed and tested,” she told the Taoiseach.
“It sounds to me like you’re quite prepared to throw farming families under the bus,” she added, stating that maybe his government had bigger corporate interests at heart.
“That’s how it sounds to me and I think that’s who it sounds to the farmers at the gate.”
Varadkar said the government would assess the deal, but admitted there are “downsides” to the beef sector.
However, he said there are “upsides” for other sectors like dairy and other businesses. He said the beef coming to the EU must be of the same standards produced by Irish farmers.
In a statement toTheJournal.ie,the Department of Agriculture noted that neither the Minister for Agriculture nor the Department “can legally have any role in determining the prices for beef or any other commodity”.
The Department said it is AFM is “currently in the process of transposing into national law the EU Directive 2019 /633 on unfair trading practices in business to business relationships in the agricultural and food supply chain which entered into force on 30 April 2019″.
“The Directive applies to agricultural and food products and protects weaker suppliers against stronger buyers against a specific 16 unfair trading practises which can occur in the food supply chain,” it said.
In relation to the quality of beef imports to the EU from third countries, the Department noted that “food products placed on the European marketplace are covered by a range of legislation designed to ensure that products supplied to consumers are of the highest safety standards”.
“DAFM are satisfied that the controls and checks in place and enforced by the Department ensure that EU consumers are protected and correctly informed when they purchase and consume food products.”

He said however that “the majority of these have been assigned to customs roles or to backfill positions from which existing Revenue staff have been assigned to customs duties”.
He said: “As serving staff are taking up their new Brexit-related positions, Revenue is backfilling the vacancies created, from panels of candidates established in its general recruitment activity.”
The Minister explained: “In the period from 2017 to date, Revenue has assigned over 450 additional staff to customs related roles, deployed across a range of functions, with the majority assigned to import and export trade facilitation activities and policy and operational roles. Resources are deployed based on the evolving business needs and to tackle any risks as they emerge.

Minister Donohoe has confirmed that 281 staff have been assigned to Dublin in preparation for Brexit, including 213 in 2019.
In addition, 119 have been assigned in Munster including 104 this year with a further 40 assigned in Leinster, excluding Dublin and Louth.
In his written reply, Minister Donohoe stated that Revenue has determined that in a‘Central Case’ scenario – an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU, to include a transition period until the end of 2020 – an additional 600 Revenue staff would be required.
He said that in September 2018, the Government granted approval in principle for the phased recruitment of an additional 600 Revenue staff to meet the challenges posed by Brexit.
In Budget 2019, Revenue was provided with an additional €10 million pay provision, for 270 of the additional 600 staff to be recruited during 2019.
Following a Government decision in December 2018, it was agreed to accelerate Revenue’s recruitment programme in preparation for Brexit.
Minister Donohoe stated: “Revenue will continue to adjust its recruitment and training plans in response to business needs, including Brexit-related developments.”","7.56pm, 10 Jul 2019",

SO IT’S OFFICIAL. Boris Johnson will be taking over 10 Downing Street tomorrow.
After a protracted leadership race, the former mayor of London was announced as the new leader of the Conservative Party today, winning 66% of the vote.
Theresa May will then step aside tomorrow, paving the way for the Uxbridge and South Ruislip MP to become the Prime Minister.
And, with the new Brexit deadline of 31 October a full 100 days away now, Johnson will have little time to decide the path forward.
Anne Milton announced her resignation just before Johnson’s election, while David Gauke and Rory Stewart reiterated their intention to resign in the aftermath.

So, how’s it all going to happen over the next couple of days.
My colleague Gráinne Ní Aodhahas you sorted onTheJournal.iethis morning.
Here are the main points:
It’s been flagged that Boris Johnson can expect a number of resignations from within Theresa May’s existing Cabinet if he becomes prime minister.
Yesterday, the Europe Minister Alan Duncan pre-empted a Johnson premiership by stepping down.
A long time critic of the former London mayor, Duncan tweeted last year that Johnson’s comparison of May’s Brexit strategy toa suicide vestwas “one of the most disgusting moments in British politics”.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond is perhaps the most high-profile minister to confirm they’ll resign if Johnson becomes prime minister.
If – or perhaps more accurately, when – Boris Johnson is announced as the new Conservative leader, we can expect a flurry of resignations from MPs who disagree with his Brexit policy.
Speaking of Brexit policy, what can we expect from Johnson when he becomes prime minister regarding the UK’s protracted exit from the EU?
Well, before coming out to definitively back leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum, Johnson apparently wrote a pro-leaveandpro-remain column, setting out the argument for both sides.
But since becoming a Brexiteer, he has repeatedly advocated no-deal if the EU won’t compromise on issues such as the Northern Irish backstop.
During the race to become the next Tory leader, he has said that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October “come what may, do or die”.
This is, of course, bad news for Ireland as a no-deal Brexit would have a very damaging effect on the whole island and its economy.
Whether Johnson’s rhetoricafterbecoming prime minister matches what he’s been saying beforehand remains to be seen.
Perhaps surprisingly, the Tory leadership battle doesn’t lead most British newspapers this morning.
Instead, most opt to cover the case of a man – who accused UK establishment figures of sexual abuse – found guilty of perverting the course of justice.

For his part, Johnson has been adopting a rather more optimistic tone at the prospect of a new deal with EU – which has been ruled out again and again by the EU.
Writingin his column in the Daily Telegraph, he said yesterday that if landing on the Moon was possible, then it’s possible to find a solution to the Irish border problem.
In particular, he cites the computer on the Apollo spacecraft which ran on a hand-woven ‘code’ of wires and metal rings, as well as the bravery of the astronauts.
“And yet it was with the help of that computer, and with the gumption of those pilots, that the Americans were able to perform the quite incredible feat not just of landing on the moon, but of getting back in one piece.”
Johnson uses this as a basis to argue that technological solutions at the Irish border are possible, and seems to hint in favour of a deal: “We can come out of the EU on October 31, and yes, we certainly have the technology to do so.”
So how will the Conservative party in general react to Johnson as leader?
There’s still a large number of them who want to avoid a no-deal at all costs.
Former leadership candidate Rory Stewart was seen as the most moderate candidate vying to be the new prime minister.
In this interview yesterday, he says he’s not prepared to serve in a Boris Johnson government. He’s also asked how “dangerous” he thinks Boris Johnson is. He waits a long time before answering.

Of course, many are having their say on Johnson as he waits in the wings to step into the top job.
Adding to the commentary yesterday was AIB chairman Richard Pym, who was speaking at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties, Co Donegal.
Referring to how the soon-to-be prime minister once described the  relationship between Ireland, the EU and the backstop as the “tail wagging the dog”, Pym said:
“If you mess with an animal’s tail, you risk ending up with a dump of s**t on your own feet.”
And Pym wasn’t done.
“As chairman of AIB I am regularly interviewing prospective new directors as we replace departing ones… So, what if a candidate appeared in front of my desk with uncombed hair who had been dismissed from two previous positions in his career for … shall we say… being economical with the truth… It would be a very easy decision to reject that candidate, notwithstanding the charisma which they showed in interview. “
So what exactly is Johnson’s Brexit plan?
Just to recap, Theresa May’s government reached a withdrawal agreement with the EU after years of negotiations. That deal was rejected three times by MPs, leading to her downfall and Johnson’s now-expected ascension.
He’s put forward a number of options to avoid a no-deal, but most are light on exact detail and it’s been argued that they simply can’t be done as the EU has said it will not renegotiate.
Plan A
This would see Johnson negotiating a new agreement altogether. Yet even he admits it might be a stretch.
Furthermore, he has little time. The House of Commons is stopping so MPs can go on their summer holidays on Thursday.
The summer break and leadership transitions in London and Brussels leave a matter of weeks in September and October for formal talks.
Plan B
Johnson’s alternative starts with parliament ratifying “the best bits” of May’s deal.
What it explicitly excludes is the dreaded backstop – the key provision that avoids a hard border in Northern Ireland no matter the outcome of talks over the future relationship between the UK and EU.
Johnson also wants to adopt a policy of “constructive ambiguity” over whether Britain will start paying off its estimated £39 billion (€43 billion) withdrawal bill.
The cash pile would be used as leverage to get Brussels to sign off on a “standstill” agreement that rolls over existing trade rules until a new treaty is signed.
Johnson envisions gradually unrolling a mix of “technology-based solutions” and waiver agreements that keep the Irish frontier free-flowing over this interim span.
He argues that everything can be settled “well before” Britain’s next scheduled election in May 2022. Again, the EU has indicated it wouldn’t be willing to agree to it.
Plan C
This is high-stakes gambling territory.
Should the threat of the UK jumping off the cliff of no-deal force the hand of EU leaders to avoid it?
While a no-deal would cause significant harm to the UK economy, it would also cause damage to its key trading partners – including Ireland.
Can the UK dangle calamity in front of the EU to get them to cooperate and secure a favourable deal? That remains to be seen.
Jeremy Hunt may be the forgotten man in this leadership race, and he also appears aware how today is going to go.
Speaking to reporters outside his home in the last few mins, he said: “I’m feeling positive, but who knows what’s going to happen?”
He looks well placed for a senior job in a Johnson Cabinet afterwards at the least.

Theresa May is chairing her last Cabinet as prime minister this morning.
No one is in any doubt over who’ll be chairing the next one according to the BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley.

https://www.thejournal.ie/tory-leadership-race-ireland-4677128-Jun2019/,"THERE ARE 10 Conservative MPs all vying to be the next leader of the party and the next British prime minister, to succeed Theresa May.
Whoever is chosen will take up the reins in the midst of a crisis – Brexit woes and electoral woes being chief among them.
All 10 claim they will be the one to “sort out” Brexit once and for all, and for that exact reason, Irish eyes will be watching keenly who is chosen. The path they choose out of the EU will have major consequences here.
Most pertinently, the backstop – the safety net designed to prevent the installation of a hard border in Northern Ireland by guaranteeing it stays “aligned” with the customs and trading rules of Ireland and the EU – is seen as unacceptable by the vast majority of candidates.
Many have pledged to cut the Irish backstop out of the UK’s withdrawal agreement with the EU, despite the EU and Ireland repeatedly saying this is not an option.
So how do each of the candidates feel about Ireland? Many have spoken at length on the backstop and other Irish issues, but some are tackling the issue only recently in a bid to show their leadership credentials.
Let’s take a look.
Frank Augstein / PA ImagesFrank Augstein / PA Images / PA Images
So what does the favourite to be the new Tory leader think of the border issue and Ireland?
He has consistently rallied against the backstop and played down the significance of the current soft border in Northern Ireland.
Dating back to his time as foreign secretary, the occasionally gaffe prone former London Mayor was often derided for some of his comments on Ireland and the border.
Back in 2017, before it became clear how this was all going to go, Johnson was speaking quite positively, however. In September of that year, he said solving the Irish border issue was “not beyond the wit of man”.
Perhaps indicative of how his own officials felt about Boris –although this was strenuously denied by the government– Sky News reported in November 2017 that the UK Foreign Office told Irish officials “not to listen” to Boris Johnson ahead of his visit for talks with Tánaiste Simon Coveney.
‘Beyond belief’
In February 2018, Johnson drew consternation when he likened the challenge of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland to the boundaries between different boroughs of London.
He called it a “very relevant comparison”.
In June of that year, an audio recordingobtained by Buzzfeed Newswas released where Johnson said it’s “beyond belief” that relations in Northern Ireland were dictating the Brexit debate.
He said said that concerns about the Irish border were “pure millennium bug stuff” and referenced “planes falling from the sky”.
“We’re allowing the whole of our agenda to be dictated by this folly.”
EU colony
After resigning as foreign secretary, Johnson repeatedly attacked Theresa May’s policies, saying in October 2018that the Irish backstop would make the UK “an EU colony”.
Speaking at the Pendulum Summit in Dublin in January,Johnson claimed that “nobody will implement” a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Johnson said that there are technological solutions to the border issue that have not been explored.
“Nobody will implement it. We should not abandon attempts to find a technological solution to the border without even trying,” he said during his speech. Such technological solutions have been repeatedly rejected by Ireland and the EU, both stating they don’t yet exist.
Speaking on other matters in Northern Ireland, Johnson was heavily criticised in March for suggesting that if soldiers involved in Bloody Sundaywere charged with murder, it would be for political reasons.
Consistently railing against the backstop and flirting with the idea of leaving without a deal, Johnson said in an interview with the Sunday Times last weekend that, as prime minister, he would refuse to pay Britain’s £39 billion divorce bill until the EU agrees better withdrawal terms.
The ex-London mayor also signalled he would scrap the much-despised backstop and try to settle the border issue once London and Brussels were negotiating their future relationship.
David Mirzoeff / PA ImagesDavid Mirzoeff / PA Images / PA Images
Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s most noteworthy comments on Ireland came just in the past week, with a suggestion that the UK must spend big to solve the issue.
In an interview with theMail On Sunday, Javid said Britain should pay the Irish government half a billion pounds to break the Brexit deadlock over the Northern Ireland border issue.
Citing the UK signing the Good Friday Agreement, he said Britain has a moral duty to pay for a new border arrangement, warning it will take “hundreds of millions of euros, no one really knows because it hasn’t been done before”.
Javid wants the money to be used to set up new technological solutions along the border that will mean the UK can leave the single market and customs union but also maintain no hard border on the island Ireland. These kinds of solutions have been suggested by many, but detail is so far lacking on what they could be.
At the beginning of this month, he also indicated that he wants to renegotiate the backstop,telling the BBC’s Andrew Marrthat “Ireland is key”.
“It’s the tail that wags the dog on this,” he said. “We need to make sure that we can do more to build that goodwill with Ireland, to give them that confidence.”
Javid has consistently railed against the backstop, and also indicated his belief that border checks couldbe done with “existing technology” back in February.

Gove’s position on Ireland is hard to pin down.
In the year 2000, he wrote a paper called Northern Ireland: The Price of Peace, in which he said that Prime Minister Tony Blair had “capitulated” to the IRA,the BBC reportedearlier this month. He also called the Good Friday Agreement a “mortal stain”, and a “rigged referendum”.
In the past week, he has defended those comments, saying he was “unionist to his bootstraps” and had worked hard in Northern Ireland and Ireland to bring people together.
On the other hand, he backed May’s withdrawal agreement during the doomed House of Commons votes.
Last December, he retweeted an article from the Daily Telegraph urging people to read it and saying it’s why the prime minister’s deal should be supported. That article led with the line that the backstop “isn’t actually that bad for Britain”.

As it comes to the crunch, however, it’s clear he’s no longer a backstop fan pledging as he launched his leadership campaign on Monday that he’d put a “full stop to the backstop”,the Times Ireland reported.

The current foreign secretary is another candidate who wants the backstop gone.

Hunt was a supporter of May with talk of “compromise” as she tried to get her withdrawal agreement through.
Around Christmas time, he was calling for more assurances from the EU that the backstop would only be temporary, telling BBC Radio 4 that “we can get this through, [we] absolutely can”.
Like many of his rivals for the leadership, however, Hunt’s stance has hardened. He haseven claimed that German Chancellor Angela Merkel told him the EU was willing to renegotiate the Brexit withdrawal deal.
Speaking to Sky News at the weekend, Hunt said a technological solution was “doable” but “we have to find the mechanisms to deal with the situation”.
Stefan Rousseau / PA ImagesStefan Rousseau / PA Images / PA Images
Unlike some of her other colleagues, Leadsom doesn’t want to ditch the backstop and Ireland hasn’t really featured in her campaign at all.
The former House of Commons leader doesn’t think it’s workable to get a deal with the EU that drops it so she wants a “managed no deal” instead, that proposes a “virtual border” solution using the aforementioned technology.
She wants Parliament to pass through some aspects of May’s withdrawal deal and bring the UK out of the EU at the end of October.
These aspects would include ensuring the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. She also wants a summit with EU leaders in September to discuss the “sensible” measures for a “smooth” exit.
Speaking to Sky News this week, she said: “Essentially, I believe the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead. The EU won’t change it and parliament won’t vote for it and we have to leave the EU at the end of October.”

Raab was a backbencher until the 2015 general election, and a number of different ministerial positions before he was promoted to Brexit Secretary in July 2018. He stepped down from this role in November.
The former Brexit secretary famously resigned because he was dissatisfied with a deal he helped to negotiate.
He is also well-known for admitting he hadn’t read the Good Friday Agreement in full, saying that he’s used it as “a reference tool” during Brexit negotiations, but that it isn’t “a cracking read”.
In quitting the Cabinet last November, Raab aid he believed the regulatory regime proposed for Northern Ireland presented a “very real threat” to the United Kingdom’s integrity.
Raab added that he was opposed to “an indefinite backstop arrangement” to guarantee the Irish border remains free-flowing, saying the EU would hold “a veto over our ability to exit”.
His stance on Brexit has hardened ever since.
A Raab premiership may prove difficult for the Irish government. In January of this year,the government rubbished claimsfrom Raab that the Taoiseach leaked inaccurate information about him to the media.
He claimed that Varadkar leaked the information in a way designed to misinterpret him, but the adviser to Tánaiste Simon Coveney dismissed the allegation as “pure spoof”.
Raab also told a Commons Select Committee that the Irish  government took “a trenchant line on the backstop”, and that it was in “a very difficult position now” blaming it on the “particularly strong political position taken by the Taoiseach”.
He has believed there’s a “compromise” and a way out of the border issue, if the Irish government was willing to concede some ground.
“There’s three ways of dealing with it: you either change the entire paradigm so you don’t have a legislative alignment approach; you have an operation- and technology-based approach; or you limit through time or an exit mechanism, the legislative alignment application,”he said in January.
Raab also claimed that a top EU official said that “Northern Ireland is the price to pay for Brexit”.TheJournal.ie‘s FactCheckrated this claim unproven.
If Raab were to become prime minister, a hard Brexit – and all that would bring for Ireland – becomes eminently more likely.

The international development secretary is by far seen as the most moderate candidate amongst the hopefuls.
He’s also supportive of the current deal – including the backstop, saying it’s unlikely the EU would countenance any deal without it.
In a video on his Twitter last week, he spoke to farmers in Northern Ireland about the serious effects a no-deal Brexit would have on them.

He stands as the only one of the 10 contenders who wants to get the current deal left over from Theresa May through parliament.
Stewart has told other candidates: “Stop ignoring the Irish border and all that it means for Northern Ireland. And tell me how what you propose is going to work on the Irish border.
It’s fair to say that the kind of Brexit Stewart is proposing is the one that – while any Brexit will affect Ireland negatively – would impact Ireland the least.
It would allow frictionless trade to continue for the next few years, with the insurance mechanism of the backstop if future talks with the EU and UK fail.

The health secretary wants a soft border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and he’s not completely given up on the backstop just yet.
Hancock wants a time-limited backstop, and says he would aim to work with the EU to find a “long-term, administrative and technological solution”.
He wants to work with the Irish government to find the solutions, but it’s not clear how successful this would be.
David Mirzoeff / PA ImagesDavid Mirzoeff / PA Images / PA Images
A hardline Brexiteer, McVey’s stance is similar to Leadsom’s – ditch the backstop, leave without a deal in October.
Last year, she was insisting the backstop must be dropped and said in December that May should’ve gone back to the EU to get a better deal.
The former work and pensions secretary was roundly criticised in recent weeks for claiming that there would be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit because an “invisible” option would be in place instead.
She’s hit headlines this week for being blanked by former colleague Lorraine Kelly on ITV breakfast TV.
Kirsty Wigglesworth / PA ImagesKirsty Wigglesworth / PA Images / PA Images
The former Conservative chief whip also wants the backstop gone. He’s backing the“Malthouse” proposalthat was floated in the House of Commons at the beginning of this year but ultimately came to nothing.
Essentially, it would replace the backstop with “alternative arrangements” but it’s not immediately clear what these are.
Writing in The Daily Telegraph last year, Harper said he’d seen the border first hand in Fermanagh and said current arrangements had to be maintained. In it, he talks about the technology that could make the border situation work, saying “this can be catered for by international practices that already exist”.
Speaking now, he says that “sensible cooperation” could resolve the border issue.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-triggered-psychosis-4833163-Oct2019/,"A DOCTOR HAS warned that political upheaval can take a serious toll on mental health as he revealed details about the first reported case of Brexit-triggered psychosis.
The male patient, aged in his 40s, suffered hallucinations and delusions when his mental health “deteriorated rapidly” shortly after the results of the Brexit referendum in summer 2016.
The man also became increasingly worried about racial incidents and, after being admitted on to a psychiatric ward, said he felt ashamed to be British.
Dr Mohammad Zia Ul Haq Katshu, who treated the patient, wrote in the British Medical Journal: “His wife reported that since the EU referendum results were declared on 24 June 2016, he started spending more time putting his thoughts across on social media.
“He found it difficult to reconcile with the political events happening around him. He became increasingly worried about racial incidents. His sleep deteriorated.”
Once admitted, the unnamed patient was described as agitated, attempting to “burrow” through the hospital floor with his hands to “get the hell out of this place”.
He believed he was being spied on and that talks on the radio were directed at him. He later said: “I was looking at the electoral map of voting for the EU. I am in a constituency that reflects an opinion that is not for me.”
Dr Katshu warned that political events can act as “major psychological stressors” in the article, which was published in BMJ Case Reports.

Previous surveys have shown that concerns over the future of the UK after the Brexit referendum and the future of the US after the 2016 presidential election were significant sources of stress.
Family and work stress
Dr Katshu wrote of the patient: “His mental health had deteriorated rapidly following the announcement of the results, with significant concerns about Brexit.
The patient also reported experiencing family pressures, and the doctor said it is possible these and work-related stress also contributed to the man’s illness.
The patient was diagnosed with acute schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder, a category of acute and transient psychotic disorder (ATPD) – the first case believed to have been triggered by Brexit.
The illness is characterised by an acute onset of symptoms and complete recovery within three months.
The patient described his experiences as “intense periods of accelerated thinking, of being distracted and consumed by my own thoughts, and of a series of theatrical episodes of which I am at the centre”.
The man recovered completely within a fortnight after a brief admission and treatment with olanzapine, an antipsychotic.
He had experienced a similar episode 13 years previously following work-related stress. But he had no family history of mental health problems, history of alcohol or substance misuse, or physical health issues barring mildly impaired hearing in one ear.
He has remained well until at least June 2019, when doctors last had contact with him.

https://www.thejournal.ie/impact-of-brexit-on-online-shopping-4793088-Sep2019/,"CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN warned about the impact Brexit could have on online shopping.
The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is today launching a six-week public awareness campaign in a bid to prepare consumers for the potential impact of Brexit on their rights when they buy online from UK-based retailers.
As part of the campaign, the CCPC has published research that shows 72% of Irish consumers have bought online from a company based in the UK in the last two years.
The most popular items bought were clothing, electronics and footwear.
One of the main rights consumers have when they buy online from an EU-based retailer is the right to change their mind and receive a refund within a certain timeframe.
The CCPC’s research, which surveyed 1,000 adults around Ireland, found that 40% of those who had bought from a UK retailer had returned items.
When asked about their reason for returning items, 55% of people said they returned a purchase because the product did not fit or suit their needs and 16% said they had changed their mind. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, these rights may not be guaranteed, the CCPC said.
When asked about changing their shopping behaviour as a result of Brexit, the research found that 31% of people plan to buy more from websites in other EU countries.

However, 25% of consumers who have bought online from the UK plan to make no changes to their online shopping habits.
Extra VAT
Given the uncertainty around Brexit, the CCPC has advised consumers to be aware of the potential changes and to take action before they buy online from the UK.
Speaking today, Isolde Goggin, Chair of the CCPC, said consumers who buy from EU-based businesses “have very strong consumer rights if something goes wrong, for example if you don’t get your items delivered”.
However, when Brexit happens people will no longer be guaranteed these rights when buying products from UK-based retailers.
“Also check to see if there are costs for returning items. Make sure you are happy with these before you purchase anything,” Goggin said.
Britain is due to leave the European Union, with or without a deal, on 31 October.
Speaking today, Minister for Business Heather Humphreys TD said consumers “should also be aware that following Brexit, they may have to pay certain taxes and duties including customs duty, excise duty and VAT, if they are buying from UK traders”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-corporation-tax-no-deal-central-bank-warnings-4820672-Sep2019/,"A DISORDERLY BREXIT would cause higher spending, growing unemployment and rising debt, adding to the vulnerability of the Irish economy over the next decade, according to a new report by three Central Bank economists.
The report, published today, also contains a stark warning about how a loss of corporation tax and a global economic slowdown, would impact Ireland.
“A disorderly Brexit or a loss of corporation tax revenue accompanied by a slowdown in the international economy would both result in a material increase in the government debt,” the analysis by Thomas Conefrey, Rónán Hickey and Graeme Walsh warns.
Brexit
As fears grow of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, the government has issued repeated warnings of the impact it would have on the Irish economy.
Both Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney haveupped their warningsin recent months about what a disorderly Brexit will mean for Ireland.
Advertisement
The paper, while not an official Central Bank document, suggests that government debt would rise significantly as consumer spending drops, imports and exports are disrupted due to new tariffs and unemployment grows.
Crucially, the report predicts that a disorderly Brexit will have a long-term, damaging impact on Ireland’s public finances over the next decade – and ultimately leave the economy more vulnerable.
The authors write that a disorderly Brexit, such as a no-deal, would reduce the level of output of the Irish economy by 4% in the short-term and 6% over 10 years.
It also predicts that the unemployment rate would rise by two percentage points in the long-term.
The report warns that by 2025 the debt-to-income ratio would grow by 17 percentage points, with debt €22 billion higher than the alternative case if Brexit didn’t happen.
Larger deficits and a growing government debt would leave the Irish economy open to “further shocks” in the years to come, the authors warn.
Corporation Tax
The analysis also contains a sober warning about the Irish economy’s reliance on corporation tax.

Between 2014 and 2018, corporation tax revenue in Ireland grew by 125%, contributing 40% to the overall growth of tax revenue. However,concerns have grownthat the country is becoming too reliant on corporation tax receipts.
In June, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council warned that Ireland needs to“wean itself”off its reliance on corporation tax.
The authors warn corporation tax may “not be sustainable over the long term”.
A reduction in tax revenue, combined with a much-feared global economic slowdown, could have damaging consequences for the country and contribute to a rise in government debt.
The report also warns that if a disorderly Brexit and a corporation tax revenue drop were combined “the effects on the economy and public finances would be magnified”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/motor-insurance-green-card-northern-ireland-4778606-Aug2019/,"IRISH MOTORISTS WILL no longer require a so-called ‘Green Card’ to drive Irish-registered vehicles in the UK, including the North, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Motor Insurers’ Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) announced that it has struck a deal with the UK Department of Transport to accept Irish insurance discs as proof of insurance after the UK leaves the European Union.
The card is an international document which shows proof that a motorist has the minimum level of car insurance required by a country they are visiting.
Currently, Irish-registered vehicles that travel within the EU are covered by the terms of the EU Motor Insurance Directive.
Butahead of the original Brexit date on 29 March, the MIBI warned motorists that they would require the Green Cards to travel to the North and the rest of the UK if a no-deal Brexit occurred.

That will no longer be the case, following a deal between the group and the UK’s Department of Transport, which MIBI Chief Executive David Fitzgerald hailed as ”really positive news”.
“Earlier this year a lot of concern was expressed about the insurance recognition issues raised by the evolving Brexit situation,” he said.
“Suddenly drivers were faced with a new requirement for Green Cards in light of the UK’s potential exit from the European Union without an agreement…
“Thankfully, the UK has now confirmed that valid insurance discs meet the requirements set out in UK legislation and so can be used as proof of motor insurance cover in the UK.
“Therefore, a more streamlined process will apply for Irish registered vehicles with valid insurance discs.”
However, motorists have been advised that Green Cards will still be required for UK-registered vehicles visiting European Union countries, including Ireland, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The cards will not be required if an agreement is reached between the UK and the EU on Brexit, or if a transitional arrangement is implemented.

https://www.thejournal.ie/donohoe-budget-brexit-4805677-Sep2019/,"MINISTER FOR FINANCE Paschal Donohoe has said the government won’t “make the mistake” of lowering personal taxes in this Budget in case they might have to increase it in future due to the effects of Brexit.
Speaking toRTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland, Donohoe reiterated that Budget 2020 will be based on a no-deal Brexit.
While increases to social welfare had become a regular fixture in recent Budgets, the minister said that any increases will be “very targeted”.
At last year’s Fine Gael Ard Fheis, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar committedto increasing the point at which people pay the top rate of tax to €50,000. Given the looming threat of Brexit, that won’t be happening any time soon.

Donohoe said: “I was saying that as well… [but] we need safe national finances. We won’t make the mistake of decreasing the tax the one day and having to increase it the next.
On the potential for a carbon tax, Donohoe said he was “actively considering what way this can be done”. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said on Tuesdaythat there would “need to be” a carbon tax in Budget 2020.
Turning to the supports that would be available to businesses most at risk due to a no-deal Brexit, the minister said these would be “highly targeted” to companies that need support.
“The rainy day fund is one of the options I’ll consider,” he said.
Donohoe added that a “better performance” is required in public expenditure with overruns last year in health and other departments “not acceptable”.
Budget 2020 will be announced on 8 October.

TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said he doesn’t expect any breakthroughs in relation to Brexit during his meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson next week.
The two leaders are due to meet in Dublin on Monday. It will be the first time they’ve met since Johnson succeeded Theresa May in July.
Speaking in Waterford this evening, Varadkar said: “I don’t expect any breakthroughs on Monday.
“It is the first time that we’re meeting as Taoiseach and Prime Minister.
“It’s an opportunity to establish a personal relationship, an opportunity for us to talk about each other’s positions in relation to the European Union and the Withdrawal Agreement, to explore where there might be common ground,” Varadkar told RTÉ News.

Varadkar said he and Johnson will also discuss the ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland, which has been without a functioning government since January 2017.
“Separate from the major issue of Brexit, there is the ongoing suspension of the Assembly and the Executive in Northern Ireland. The Tánaiste and I are working very hard with the Secretary of State to get those institutions up and running – we think that can be done,” Varadkar said.
Backstop
The Taoiseach and the EU have repeatedly said that the backstop element of the Withdrawal Agreement – which would see Northern Ireland stay aligned to the regulations of thesingle market and the customs unionif there is still no other solution that would avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland – cannot be removed from the deal.
Johnson disagrees and wants this and other elements of the deal to be renegotiated. The EU has consistently said the only deal available is the one already on the table.
Varadkar said this evening that there would be plenty of “lead-in time” if checks near the border are introduced in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The House of Lords earlier today approved a bill that would force the UK government to seek a three-month extension to the Brexit deadline if no deal has been agreed with the European Union by 19 October. The bill is expected to be signed into law by Queen Elizabeth on Monday.
On Wednesday night, British MPs voted against holding a general election on 15 October. MPs are due to vote again on Monday in relation to an election; opposition parties have said they will not back the motion.
Speaking at an event in Yorkshire yesterday, Johnson said he would “rather be dead in a ditch” than seek another Brexit extension from the EU. The current deadline is 31 October.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-election-brexit-4797317-Sep2019/,"UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has said that a general election is the only route out of the current Brexit impasse.
During an extraordinary press conference, following a speech to police cadets in Yorkshire this afternoon, the Prime Minister reiterated that he will take the UK out of the European Union on 31 October, saying that he would “rather be dead in a ditch” than seek another Brexit extension from the EU.

“It achieves absolutely nothing. What on earth is the point of further delay,” he added.
The comments come after the House of Commons rejected the government’s plan for a snap general election last night.
Johnson said that the British public must be given the opportunity to decide the fate of Brexit with an election on 15 October and the people must choose between sending him or Jeremy Corbyn to the EU council meeting two days later.
“I don’t want an election at all … But frankly I don’t see any other way,” he said. “It’s the only way to get this thing moving.”
Johnson also faced repeated questions from reporters about his brotherJo’s resignationfrom politics, which was announced earlier today.

“Jo doesn’t agree with me about the European Union because obviously it’s an issue that, obviously, divides families and divides everybody,” he said.
“But what I think Jo would agree is that we need to get on and sort this thing out.”

During the speech one of the police officers standing behind Johnson stood down. Reports in UK media suggest she was ill. Johnson expressed concern for her well being before winding up the press conference.
Johnson making the speech against the backdrop of the police cadets has drawn criticism from political opponents, including Diane Abbott and Yvette Cooper, who labelled it an “abuse of power”.
“Does he realise this makes him look anything other than strong? I can’t remember a Prime Minister who looked this weak so soon after taking office,” Labour MP David Lammy said.

“I now feel that it is time for me to make a change and embrace a new challenge. After a very great deal of thought, I have decided not to stand again as a candidate at the next general election,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-deal-this-week-poll-4851244-Oct2019/,"ALMOST SEVEN IN 10 people in Ireland don’t think there will be a Brexit deal by the end of this week.
According to an opinion poll carried out by Amarách Research for RTÉ’s Claire Byrne Live/TheJournal.ie, just 8% of people think a deal will be reached by the end of this week.
A total of 69% don’t believe a deal will be reached this week, while 23% of those surveyed are unsure.
70% of men surveyed don’t believe a deal will be reached this week, while 10% think there will be a deal.
69% of women surveyed think a deal will not be reached this week, while just 6% believe there will be a deal.
Today, UK and EU officials resumed talks in Brussels with the prospects of an agreement in time for Britain to leave with a deal on 31 October in the balance.

Time is rapidly running out if there is to be an agreement to put to EU leaders to sign off on at their two-day summit starting on Thursday.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said “technical-level” talks between officials over the weekend had proved “constructive”.
However, in a briefing to ambassadors of the remaining EU27 yesterday in Brussels, he said that “a lot of work remains to be done”.
Earlier, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told senior ministers that while a “pathway” to a deal could still be seen, there was “still a significant amount of work to get there”.
In a Cabinet conference call, he said that they still had to be prepared to leave on Halloween without a deal.
The sticking point remains the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop intended to guarantee there is no return of a hard border with the Republic.
Barnier was reported to have raised concern about the complexity of a British plan to keep Northern Ireland in the UK customs territory while avoiding the need for border controls.
There were reported to be doubts about the feasibility of the scheme which was said to involve tracking goods as they move through Northern Ireland and then determining the tariff to be paid depending where they end up.

It raised the prospect that negotiations could carry on after this week, with the possibility of an emergency EU summit at the end of the month to finally approve any 11th hour agreement.
However, if Johnson cannot get a deal by the weekend, he will come under intense pressure to seek a further Brexit delay, something he has vowed not to do.
Labour, however, has warned that if necessary it will take action through the courts to force him to comply with the so-called Benn Act which requires him to request an extension.
Either way, the stage is set for a major showdown when the Prime Minister returns to Westminster for an emergency Saturday sitting of Parliament, the first in 37 years.

https://www.thejournal.ie/boris-johnson-new-prime-minister-4737291-Jul2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON IS set to become the British prime minister today, having been announced as the new Conservative Party leader yesterday.
Johnson was elected by 92,153 votes to 46,656, securing support from66.4% of the party memberswho voted.
Theresa May will take part in her final Prime Minister’s Questions at midday, before meeting Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace at 3pm to hand in her resignation.
Shortly afterwards, at about 3.30pm, Johnson is expected to meet the queen, who will ask him to form a new government. After being sworn in he is expected to return to Number 10 Downing Street and make a speech.
Johnson will then start forming his new Cabinet, with much speculation as to who is in and who is out.
Senior sources have reportedly told Sky News the Cabinet will be made up of “two-thirds Brexiteers and one-third Remainers“.
The future role of Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, the man whom Johnson saw off in the Tory leadership contest, is uncertain.
One person who we know is definitely out is Philip Hammond – the chancellor said he would resign if Johnson was elected. Hammond said he could not serve in a government that may pursue a no-deal Brexit.
Home Secretary Sajid Javid (who ran in the Tory leadership race), former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Liz Truss, Hammond’s current deputy at the Treasury, are in the running to replace him,according to BBC News.
The Times is reporting that Brexiter Priti Patel willbecome Home Secretaryless than two years after she was forced to resign as International Development Secretary over unauthorised contact with Israeli officials.
Other ministers have previously signalled their intention to also stand aside – also citing concerns about Johnson and a no-deal Brexit – including Justice Secretary David Gauke and International Development Secretary Rory Stewart (he too unsuccessfully contested the leadership race).

Education Minister Anne Milton resigned shortly before Johnson’s win was announced yesterday.
Brexit strategy
Johnson is due to make a statement to the British parliament about his Brexit strategy tomorrow and take questions from MPs. Parliament will then begin its six-week summer recess.
Johnson is expected to attend the G7 summit in Biarritz in France from 25-27 August. He is also due to attend a European Union summit on 17 and 18 October if Britain is still in the bloc at that stage.
Given the looming Brexit deadline of 31 October, which he has promised to meet, Johnson is not expected to enjoy a honeymoon period.
Last week, MPs in Westminster backed a bid to stop the future prime minister from suspending parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit. On Thursday 315 MPs voted in favour of the amendment, while 274 voted against it.
Backstop
The Conservatives do not have a majority in the House of Commons, but govern through an alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party.
May announced her resignation after failing to get her Brexit deal through parliament, faced with opposition from both Conservative MPs and the DUP.
Many politicians have raised concerns about the backstop element of the Withdrawal Agreement, which aims to avoid a hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and could see the North stay aligned to some EU rules.
The DUP, which campaigned in favour of Brexit, believes the backstop threatens the UK and could lead to a trade border in the Irish Sea.
Barring a third postponement or an earlier departure, Britain is due to leave the EU on 31 October. Plans are being made at British, Irish and European level in the event of a no-deal scenario, which seems increasingly likely.
At the weekend, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said a no-deal Brexit “will be a disaster for us all” and “devastate the Northern Irish economy”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/extension-boris-brexit-eu-tusk-boris-4859405-Oct2019/,"LAST UPDATE|20 Oct 2019
A SENIOR CABINET minister has insisted that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, despite parliament forcing Boris Johnson to seek an extension yesterday.
Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no deal planning, told Sky News today that the UK would still be leaving the EU on 31 October.
The EU is currently weighing up how to respond to the prime minister’s extension request, which he sent yesterday after an embarrassing defeat in the House of Commons.
Johnson called Taoiseach Leo Varadkar yesterday to discuss the latest Westminster developments. No further details on that call were released.
This morning, social protection minister Regina Doherty said that she expects that Boris Johnson’s letter to the EU will face a legal challenge this week.
Johnson did not sign the extension request letter, which he accompanied with another letter to EU leaders telling them that his government did not want a delay.
“I think there are very many smart lawyers in the UK looking at the letter and will probably challenge it next week,” Doherty told a special edition of RTÉ Radio One’s Morning Ireland programme.
Doherty also said that she was “disappointed” that the House of Commons had not voted yesterday to approve the deal negotiated between the UK and the EU.
“We sincerely hope that the House of Commons can reach an agreement this week,” Doherty said.
She said that it will be “interesting” to see how the letter is received by the EU, “considering it’s not signed”.
Johnson got asenior diplomat to sendan unsigned photocopy of the request by MPs to delay withdrawal from the EU. In a second note to European Council president Donald Tusk, Johnson said a Brexit extension would be “deeply corrosive”.

Labour branded the prime minister “churlish” and “juvenile” in his attitude as Johnson stressed to Brussels he was only sending the communication at parliament’s bidding.
The agreement failed to pass through the House of Commons after the DUP united with Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party to vote against the government to force Johnson to request an extension.
Also speaking on RTÉ Radio One this morning, the DUP MP Sammy Wilson refused to say that Johnson had betrayed his party, which is still officially in a confidence and supply agreement with the UK government.
Wilson said that Johnson could use the deal to hold an election and win a majority in parliament.
“If the arithmetic in the House of Commons was different, I feel his ability to get a better deal would have been enhanced,” Wilson said.
He also said that his party would try and amend the Withdrawal Agreement Bill as it passes through parliament to “deal with some of the issues we feel need to be dealt with”.
The decision on whether to grant an extension will come down to the leaders of the remaining 27 EU nations, but it will be Donald Tusk’s job as head of the European Council to gather their views and he could call a special summit to approve an extension.
Tusk has confirmed yesterday evening that he received the letter seeking an extension.
Reaction
“We are going to deliver by the 31 October. We are going to ensure that we get this deal done,” Gove said.
He said that he had made a bet with health secretary Matt Hancock that the UK will leave before the end of the month.
Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said also today that Boris Johnson could be in contempt of parliament and the courts over the letters.
“He’s behaving like spoiled brat. Parliament made a decision and hes should abide by it,” McDonnell told Sky News.
“It drives at the heart of democracy that the prime minister must abide by the law,” he said. “A number of lawyers have already commented that this is seeking to undermine a decision of parliament.”

Legality of letter
There had been speculation that Johnson, who had committed to leaving the EU on 31 October, would refuse to sign the letter – placing him against the law and potentially in contempt of court.

It remains unclear whether Johnson’s refusal to sign the letter or his decision to send another letter explaining why his government does not want an extension will prompt any legal action.
Some legal expertssuggested thatthe only thing that matters was that Johnson had indeed complied with the law and sent the letter, which was also accompanied by an explanatory letter from the UK’s ambassador to the EU.
Immediately following hisHouse of Commons defeaton the Letwin amendment, Johnson told MPs that he would not negotiate an extension with the EU.
TheLetwin amendment, a cross-party bid to seek an extension in order to ensure legislation backing up the new deal is through the House before Brexit happens, was passed yesterday afternoon by a margin of 322 to 306.
It forced Johnson to seek an extension under the Benn Act, passed through parliament against the wishes of the government in September.
That vote followed hours of debate as MPs convened for what was being billed by the UK media as ‘Super Saturday’. It was the first time parliament had been convened on a Saturday for 37 years.
Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who gave his name to the act, said on Saturday: “After all the bluster, the Prime Minister has tonight sent a letter to the EU asking for an extension.”
“A bit churlish not to sign it though,” he added.

Message to Johnson. Nobody, no matter how high, is above the law and has the right to tear up our parliamentary constitution.
Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg announced in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon that there will be another Meaningful Vote on Monday.
However, it remains unclear whether Speaker John Bercow will allow the motion or not. He told MPs he would rule on it on Monday.
Second referendum
Thousands of peopletook to the streetsof London yesterday to demand a second referendum.
Speaking on the BBC Andrew Marr Show today, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that he was inviting the DUP to talk to the Labour Party.
Starmer said that his party will next week back any amendment brought forward calling for a second referendum on Johnson’s deal.
There has been speculation that the DUP might even back an amendment on a second referendum when the legislation is brought before parliament.
“Anybody who wants to improve on the situation, and they do, should be working together,” he said.
“If you want to work with us on this to improve the situation we’re in, the door is open.”
However, in a statement released this morning Wilson said that the DUP was not seeking a second referendum.
“The people of the United Kingdom were asked whether the UK should leave the EU, not whether Great Britain should leave Northern Ireland behind. We want to leave as one nation. That remains our goal,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-parliament-prorogued-4843031-Oct2019/,"THE UK PARLIAMENT will be prorogued from tonight, after the queen approved another suspension of the House of Commons this afternoon.
The British monarch approved the second prorogation of parliament in recent weeks at a meeting of the Privy Council, following a request from Prime Minister Boris Johnson to do so last week.
The business of the House of Commons will be suspended from midnight tonight until next Monday, when Johnson will set out a fresh legislative programme in a Queen’s Speech.
In a statement last week, Johnson said the Queen’s Speech would allow the Government to set out its plans for the NHS, schools, tackling crime, investing in infrastructure and building the British economy.
“We will get Brexit done on 31 October and continue delivering on these vital issues,” he said.

Johnson previously attempted to prorogue parliament for five weeks last month, before the Supreme Courtunanimously ruled on 24 Septemberthat he acted unlawfully in doing so.
The move comes as Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union teeter on the bring of collapse, amid claims from both sides of intransigence and sabotage before the Brexit deadline of 31 October.
Johnson is continuing to threaten to leave the European Union at any cost – with or without a withdrawal deal – at the end of the month.
Today he spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel as he tried to salvage new divorce terms which he had proposed ahead of a pivotal EU leaders’ summit in Brussels on 17 and 18 October.
A Downing Street source claimed that Merkel demanded a rewrite of Britain’s approach to the Irish border problem that made a compromise “essentially impossible”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-richard-pym-glenties-boris-4734743-Jul2019/,"“IF YOU MESS with an animal’s tail, you risk ending up with a dump of s**t on your own feet.”
Those were the words of the chairman of AIB, Richard Pym, while speaking about Boris Johnson at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties, in Dongeal this afternoon.
He was referring to how the British Prime Minister-in waiting once described the relationship between Ireland, the EU and the backstop as the “tail wagging the dog”.
During a debate about the potential scars Brexit could leave on the UK and the EU, Pym told the audience at the Highland Hotel that he would not restrict his comments on such an extremely serious issue, noting he would be abandoning “non-committal business-person language”.
“As chairman of AIB I am regularly interviewing prospective new directors as we replace departing ones. New directors are required to go through very extensive honesty and probity checks and to demonstrate that their personal behaviour supports an honest culture in the bank,” the Englishman said, adding:
“If on interview the candidate’s answers were evasive, deflecting in Latin vernacular, and spattered with questionably racist language. A candidate who appeared to care about nothing bar himself, and to be flashing both non-matching socks and glimpses of a possible temper.
The winner of the Tory leadership contest will be announced tomorrow, but it seems a mere formality with Johnson expected to best Jeremy Hunt.
Referring to the contest, Pym said the last remaining candidates are ”two white graduates of Oxford University”.
“They will be chosen by members of the Conservative and Unionist party, typically: white, male, 70.
Pym added that Oxford University has produced the majority of UK prime ministers over the last century.

“For those of you struggling with the difference between Oxford and Cambridge, it is simple. Both are extraordinary world class universities, but Oxford produces the prime ministers and Cambridge the Russian spies. It is hard to know which group has done more harm to the country,” he added.
As the Brexit clock runs down, Johnson has continually talked down the backstop, with his rival, Hunt, stating that it is “dead”. Tánaiste Simon Coveney has dismissed such assertions.Pym said today that Johnson’s success depends on the backstop.
“If Boris becomes Prime Minister his success depends on changing the backstop. He willconfront the issue very directly and I would expect UK/Ireland relations to get difficult.
“For all her other failings Theresa May was an honest and honourable negotiator, not terms which are normally applied to Boris.
“There will be obvious damage to Ireland from Brexit but much less than to Britain, andIreland has the support of the rest of the EU, it isn’t facing this alone. Britain is alone andbasically friendless. The scars on Ireland will be finally determined by the Brexit outcome chosen by the UK,” he added.
He said British politicians think that Europe is “just bluffing and will cave in when confronted by the British bulldog”.
“This is a dangerous fallacy, the EU is massive, it’s like an elephant looking down on some irritating yapping dog,” he added.
For Ireland, the AIB chairman said the damage from Brexit will be more serious.
If the UK decides to lower its corporation tax post-Brexit, it will herald a challenging environment for Ireland, said Pym.
He added that the Brexit vote wasn’t just a vote on Europe, it was a protest from people who felt neglected and had been persuaded that the European Union was the cause and leaving it would solve everything. “That’s what they were told,” he said.
However, he believes the UK will return back into the arms of the EU, one day.

IT’S FINALLY HAPPENED.
After almost two years of political posturing, finger-pointing and passive-aggressive statements, the UK and European Unionfinally agreeda new Brexit deal this morning.
The agreement comes after days of back-and-forth negotiations between the two sides, both of whom finally seem happy with what the other has put on the table.
One aspect of the new deal is conspicuous by its absence: the backstop on Northern Ireland.
British MPs voted three times against the previous deal, agreed in December 2017, largely over objections to the backstop.
However, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes that his new plan for the region will satisfy parliamentarians when they vote on it again this weekend.
So what’s changed in relation to the North?
Bye bye backstop
Key to today’s Brexit deal is the apparent removal of the controversial backstop from the UK’s Withdrawal Agreement.
Under the backstop, Northern Ireland would have stayed aligned to the regulations of the EU’s single market and customs union if, after Brexit, no solution to avoid a hard border was forthcoming in negotiations between the UK and the EU.
Essentially, the backstop was an insurance policy which was required because Ireland was worried about a return to a hard border.
Ireland fretted over the political implications this would have, particular because of its relationship with the six counties and the possibility of a return to Troubles-era violence.
Avoiding a hard border required Northern Ireland to have ‘regulatory alignment’ with the EU’s custom rules and regulations for products, food, animals, people and vehicles.
Without this alignment, checks and tariffs would have applied on goods, products and people travelling across the border – the EU’s only external land border with the UK.

But the idea of regulatory alignment spooked the DUP, who support the Conservative Party under a confidence-and-supply arrangement which has allowed the Tories to be in Government in the UK since a general election in 2017.

The party viewed the backstop as an attempt to leave Northern Ireland stranded from the rest of the UK, potentially leading to calls for a united Ireland.
The British government’s solution to this was to introduce a UK-wide version of the backstop instead – but that became hugely controversial because hardline Brexiteers saw it as an attempt by the EU to trap them in the union indefinitely.
As time went on, all sides refused to budge and the UK looked set to crash out of the EU without a deal – which ironically meant that a hard border would return.
That was, until today’s announcement…

Back(stop) to the future
Thenew deal, which will be voted on at a special sitting of the House of Commons on Saturday, has introduced two new arrangements affecting the North: consent and customs.
Under these terms, the backstop has now been replaced with a new protocol, whereby the North would remain aligned with the EU’s single market, but would leave the customs union along with the UK, after Brexit.
Because the North would remain in the single market, a customs and regulatory border would therefore come into effect on the Irish Sea – not unlike the original backstop.
UK authorities would then apply British tariffs to products which enter Northern Ireland, as long as they’re not destined for onward transportation across the border into Ireland.
If goods were to enter the single market by travelling across the border, EU tariffs would then be applied.
However, it’s been suggested that if goods were to stay in the North or re-entered the rest of the UK, businesses could claim back these duties in the form of a rebate.
Meanwhile, EU rules on VAT and excise duties would also apply in the North under the protocol, but the UK would be responsible for their collection and keep the revenues.
Stormont consent
The other significant aspect of the new deal refers to the role of Stormont in deciding Northern Ireland’s regulations, which has been one of the sticking points for the DUP.
More details are expected on the exact consent arrangements from the UK side, but it’s expected that the new agreement would be reviewed by Stormont every four years, beginning four years after the end of the transition period.
Then, the Northern Ireland Assembly will vote to decide whether to continue or not with the customs and regulatory arrangements. It’s been suggested that the winner of this vote will be decided by a simple majority.

Alternatively, cross-community consent for the arrangements – that is, if the vote is passed by most nationalists and most unionists – means they would remain in place for eight years.

This system aims to prevent the DUP from using the ‘petition of concern’ mechanism to veto measures designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland.
And if the Assembly does reject the arrangement, there will be a two-year cooling off period, during which the UK and the EU would work on a new approach to customs and regulations.
Moreover, a vote cannot happen if the Assembly is not operating – as is currently the case.
The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said that members of the Assembly will “bear the responsibility of maintaining the system or breaking it off”.
“We now have to place trust in the system and those who will be managing it,” he said.
‘There will be no prolongation’
Speaking after the deal was announced, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar praised the agreement as a “unique solution” which recognises the history and geography of Northern Ireland and allows the UK to leave the EU in an orderly way.
Hetweeted:
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker welcomed the deal but warned that the Brexit deadline would not be delayed beyond 31 October.
“It’s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions,” he said.
“There will be no prolongation. There is not an argument for further delay – it has to be done now.”

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed the deal allowed the UK to “take back control” of its own economic issues.
“I hope very much now that my fellow MPs in Westminster do now come together to get Brexit done to get this excellent deal over the line,” he said alongside Juncker this afternoon.
However, the DUP accused Johnson of losing his nerve and striking a bad Brexit deal in a desperate bid to avoid an extension of the deadline in two weeks’ time.
A statement by the party this afternoon said:
The party added that it would be “unable to support” the proposals in Saturday’s parliamentary vote in the House of Commons.

https://www.thejournal.ie/proroguing-parliament-unlawful-uk-constitution-4822739-Sep2019/,"EARLIER THIS WEEK, the British Supreme Court ruled that proroguing parliament was unlawful – a landmark blow against Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The unanimous ruling on Tuesday led to calls for Johnson to resign and apologise to the Queen.
After the verdict was given, Green Party MP and former party leaderCaroline Lucastold BBC News: “We would like to see a written constitution. I think we need a Citizens’ Assembly to look at our constitutional rules again. I think this whole scene has shown that they’re way, way out of sight.”
A written constitution is a formal document defining the nature of constitutional agreements and rules that govern a political system along with the rights of citizens and governments.
The UK does not have this document. Its constitution is contained within a number of sources such as conventions, works of authority, Acts of Parliaments and EU legislation.
In contrast, the Republic of Ireland’s constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann, was written in 1937 and has been amended by referendum several times.
This is not the first time a written constitution in the UK has been called for. Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow proposed considering a written constitution to stop “executive malpractice” earlier this month, theGuardianreported.
“I have been a sceptic in the past about the desirability of a written constitution for the UK,” Bercow said. “I have come to the conclusion that it’s worth establishing a royal commission or a Speaker’s conference to explore [the options].”
In the ruling on prorogation, the Supreme Court’s president Brenda Hale said it was unlawful to advise the Queen to suspend parliament because it “had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification”.
However, is it likely that these constitutional functions will be drawn up into one document anytime soon?
The questions behind a constitution
Law professor at Maynooth University Tobias Lock said that although people may now push for a constitution after this week’s ruling, he does not believe the process will start soon.
“I don’t think anyone will do it seriously at this stage because they don’t trust each other [in parliament],” Lock toldTheJournal.ie.
Lock said defenders of the current unwritten model could argue that this judgement shows the government can function without a constitution.

If the judgement had gone a different way and the court had not ruled that the suspension of parliament was unlawful, Lock said there “would have been much more of a call to fix the problem”.
The House of Commons recommenced on Wednesday after the Supreme Court ruling that prorogation of parliament was unlawful.Xinhua News Agency / PA ImagesXinhua News Agency / PA Images / PA Images
How would a constitution be written?
It is uncertain whether a written UK constitution would be a write-up of the rules as they are understood now or if they would be entirely rewritten.
Lock said the process of writing a constitution would be inclusive “to an extent”, likely taking contributions from academics, former prime ministers, the public and government representatives in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
“A big question that will probably come up with this judgement is the role of the courts,” said Lock.
“What role does the Supreme Court have in all of this? Should they be able to review legislation like here in Ireland or should they not have that power?”
The UK constitution currently “depends on convention” that people will behave in certain ways, Conservative MP Dominic Grieve told Sky News.
“What we have seen as the Brexit crisis has developed is a Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, who is increasingly willing not to observe those unwritten rules.”
‘A tempting solution’
Trinity professor of Constitutional Governance Aileen Kavanagh acknowledges that it is tempting to say the solution would be a written constitution as the issue of prorogation has led to “uncharted constitutional waters”.
“Every time there is a big constitutional issue this conversation arises, and since Brexit this has occurred quite regularly,” Kavanagh said.
She added that a written constitution containing rules on prorogation would have “at the very least” made it more difficult for a prime minister to enforce the suspension of parliament.
Trinity law professor David Kenny said he does not believe a written constitution will be drawn up soon.
“The British constitution tradition is so ancient and wedded to its unwritten status,” Kenny said.
Agreement and lack of confrontation are not currently two characteristics of British politics, meaning the proposition of a written constitution being drawn up and agreed to in the not-so-distant future is not nearly a realistic one.

The Road Safety Authority (RSA) has said that UK driving licences – including Northern Ireland – must be exchanged for an Irish licence before the 31 October.
“If there is a no-deal Brexit, then after this date, if you are living in Ireland, your UK driving licence will no longer be valid to drive here,” the RSA said in a statement today.
People who don’t apply before 31 October face possible lengthy delays in exchanging their UK licence.

In order to exchange a licence, a person must fill out an application form and present it, along with a €55 fee and their UK licence to any National Driver Licencing Service centre.
“The National Driver Licencing Service (NDLS) also cannot guarantee when you will have a valid licence to drive here in Ireland, the RSA has said.
“For this reason those living in Ireland who hold a UK driving licence are strongly urged to act now and exchange their licence,” the RSA has said.
“Brexit, in whatever form it takes, will have a significant impact on Ireland, and requires planning by Government, business and citizens,” RSA CEO Moya Murdoch has said.
Murdoch added that it is “vital” to exchange licence “before the UK leaves the EU because under current EU arrangements a UK licence holder resident here in Ireland has an entitlement to exchange the licence for an Irish driving licence.”
So far this year, over 30,000 UK licences have been exchanged for Irish driving licences.

https://www.thejournal.ie/budget-2020-heres-whats-happening-4840768-Oct2019/,"FOLLOWING WEEKS OF speculation, Budget 2020 will be revealed by Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe this afternoon.
Donohoe will take to the Dáil chamber at 1pm – with all TDs expected to be in attendance – where he will read his Budget speech outlining the fiscal measures for 2020.
Some of the measures, such as the mooted increase in VAT for cigarettes and carbon tax, are expected to come into effect at midnight tonight, while others will be phased in next year.
With €2.1 billion committed to existing projects, as outlined in the Summer Economic Statement, it was thought the remaining €700 million would be earmarked for tax cuts and increased spending.
Donohoe, however, sought approval from Cabinet to deliver measures that will mitigate against the potential economic fallout for Ireland if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 31 October.
A statement from the Department of Finance at the time said the budget aims “to give certainty to businesses and citizens” and “supporting sectors and regions most exposed to Brexit-related disruption”.
Cabinet approved the minister’s request last month and so the ‘no-deal Brexit budget’ was born.
Donohoe will outline the measures from 1pm today.Leah FarrellLeah Farrell
At the Fine Gael presidential dinner on Saturday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said “this Budget, because of Brexit, has to be different”.
“We will not be able to afford tax and welfare packages on the scale of our last three Budgets. There will, however, be a modest and targeted welfare and a minimal but targeted tax one,” he said.
Advertisement
Proposals
In recent months, political parties and organisations across the country have been submitting their proposals to the Government ahead of Budget 2020.
No measures will be officially confirmed, however, until Donohoe makes his speech in the Dáil chamber today.
Following that speech, members of the opposition parties will take to the floor for up to one hour each to make a statement on the budget measures.
Meanwhile, ministers from various government departments will attend press conferences throughout the day, addressing those measures which relate to their own departments.
What can we expect?
Income Tax was set to be the big selling point for Budget 2020 –floated by Taoiseach Leo Varadkarearlier this year – but it looks like there will be little-to-no change for workers this year.
At the beginning of the summer, Varadkar had suggested raising the income tax threshold by €2,500 over the next five years from its current level of €35,300, in the case of a single worker.
The traditional €5 increase to social welfare payments, including the old age pension, has effectively been ruled out, with the Government suggesting other measures such as home benefits will be announced to support groups like pensioners instead.
The tight spend on social welfare also prompted concerns that the Christmas bonus might be facing the chop this year.
But Donohoe indicated late last week that the payment would not be reduced or scrapped, and would be paid at the same rate of 100%, just like last year.
Discussions around the carbon taxhave been ramped up in recent weeks, as groups like Extinction Rebellion – which is engaging in a week-long protest this week – call for new measures to tackle climate change.
All measures come against the backdrop of the Brexit, and speaking on Saturday, Varadkar said “there will be a very substantial package to helps business and jobs that are viable into the future but vulnerable because of a hard Brexit, especially in sectors like tourism and agrifood.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/freedom-of-movement-4773541-Aug2019/,"THE UK’S HOME Secretary has said freedom of movement between the UK and the EU will end overnight on 31 October despite previous plans for a transition period.
Under Theresa May’s government a “transitional period” was set to be introduced for a short period with May’s government saying free movement would end “as soon as possible”.
However, a spokesperson for Home Secretary Priti Patel today said “Freedom of movement as it currently stands will end on 31 October when the UK leaves the EU” and “that tougher criminality rules for people enter the UK” will also be introduced.
More than three million EU citizens living in the UK would be affected by the plans to be implemented immediately if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
They will be required to submit an application for settled status.
Irish citizens will continue to have free movement within the UK, however, under the Common Travel Area arrangement which predates both countries joining the EU.
The latest move from Westminster has sparked criticism from those who say the latest commentary is “reckless” and “worrying”.
Fine Gael Senator and spokesperson on European Affairs Neale Richmond said: “This would not affect Irish citizens, but it would have a major impact on people travelling to the UK from the rest of the EU.”
“This is certainly very worrying and slightly reckless commentary from the Home Secretary,” he added.

He said he “certainly” didn’t expect the UK to ever back out of the Common Travel Area (CTA) agreement which predates the EU.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney said he was confident the CTA would continue unchanged despite plans announced by the British government.
“The UK and Ireland shares a common travel area giving citizens reciprocal rights to travel, work, access medical care and state supports in each other’s countries,” he said.
“These arrangements predate EU membership and earlier this year both states signed a memorandum of understanding ensuring the arrangement continues.”
Phone call
Earlier this evening, it was confirmed that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in aphonecallwhich lasted almost an hour.
A statement confirmed the two premieres spoke and stated that the common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom will not be affected by the removal of the freedom of movement for EU citizens.
The Withdrawal Agreement was also discussed during the call with both sides remaining resolute in their respective positions.
A spokesperson for Varadkar said he reinforced the EU’s position that the divorce deal is not up for renegotiation, while Johnson insisted the deal as it stands will not get through the House of Commons.

Speaking in Glasgow tonight, Major took particular aim at Dominic Cummings, calling him a “political anarchist”.
The former Conservative Party leader also said Johnson should reinstate the 21 Tory MPs ousted from the party over their stance on Brexit.
“The legitimate concerns of those who have been banished from the party … seem to be worth nothing – unless they become cyphers, parroting the views of a prime minister influenced by a political anarchist, who cares not a fig for the future of the party I have served,” Major said.
He made the comments at a dinner for business group CBI Scotland,the Guardian reports.

“Such men and women adorn parliament, and the millions whose views they represent will not forgive or forget that they have been treated so brutally…
“We have seen over-mighty advisers before. It is a familiar script. It always ends badly. I offer the prime minister some friendly advice: get rid of these advisers before they poison the political atmosphere beyond repair. And do it quickly,” Major said.
He added that Johnson’s decision to prorogue the British parliament amounts to “playing fast and loose” with the UK’s future.
Major has joined a legal challenge against the move.

However, the required two-thirds majority (434 votes) was not met as 214 Labour Party members abstained. Three Labour MPs voted for the bill and 28 against.
Johnson tabled the motion after MPs earlier voted in favour of a bill which, if passed in the House of Lords tomorrow as expected, could extend Brexit until at least 31 January 2020 (if a deal is not agreed by 19 October) in an attempt to avoid the UK leaving the European Union without a deal.
MPs are expected to vote again next week on the possibility of holding an election.
Speaking at an event in Yorkshire this evening, Johnson said he would “rather be dead in a ditch” than seek another Brexit extension from the EU. The current deadline is 31 October.

https://www.thejournal.ie/philip-hammond-warning-no-deal-brexit-4764827-Aug2019/,"THE FORMER UK Chancellor Philip Hammond has made a number of warnings about the risks of a no-deal Brexit, calling claims that the UK would be better off financially in a no-deal Brexit “absurd”.
Writing in The Times today, Hammond also chastised Johnson for “the move from demanding changes to the backstop to demanding its total removal”, which he called “a pivot from a tough negotiating stance to a wrecking one”.
Hammond, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2016, resigned from Cabinet upon Boris Johnson’s ascent to the office of Prime Minister. He cited concerns over a no-deal Brexit as the reason for his resignation, saying that the “headroom” built into public finances for Brexit could only be used if there was a Brexit deal.
The House of Commons has rejected the current Brexit deal, the Withdrawal Agreement, on three separate occasions. Despite the fact that Boris Johnson voted for the deal on 29 March, he’s vowed to get a better deal by pledging to “scrap the backstop”.

In the column today, Hammond said that this “wrecking” policy was a threat to the union:
“The clear risk that a no-deal exit will collapse the fragile peace settlement in Northern Ireland, and lead ultimately to a border poll and inevitably that a change in the status in Northern Ireland would lead to a further referendum in Scotland and the likely break-up of the UK.”
He said that this would mean that the UK would become “a diminished and inward-looking little England, inexorably squeezed between the emerging economic power blocs”.
He also warned about a free trade deal with the US, which has been cited by Boris Johnson and Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees Mogg as a lucrative replacement to the close economic and trading ties with the EU post-Brexit:
US National Security Advisor John Bolton said on Monday that the US government wanted “to move very quickly” on a trade deal with Britain after it leaves the EU, comments which were welcomed by Brexiteers.

THE UK GOVERNMENT has until midnight to submit new proposals that would replace the backstop, in another last-ditch effort to secure a deal and avoid a crash-out Brexit.
The European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that he needs good intentions to turn into a legal document after concerns were raised about an initial proposal that would keep Northern Ireland in the UK customs territory as well as the EU’s Customs Union.
This afternoon, reports emerged that Barnier called on the UK to present a legal text by the end of today. The European Council is meeting on Thursday and Friday.
Work to secure a deal has been intense after talks over the weekend, and which are understood to have gone on until 11pm on Monday, continue between EU and UK negotiators.
Asked if he recognises the deadline, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “We are working hard. The Prime Minister is aware of the time constraints that we are under.
The British government rejected claims that a deal cannot be negotiated in time for a crucial EU summit, after the Finnish prime minister said “more time” is needed.
This morning, Barnier met with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay at the General Affairs Council. Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee also met with Barclay.

Speaking in Dublin,Taoiseach Leo Varadkar saidif a deal is agreed to “on Thursday and Friday, and if the House of Commons votes in favour of that agreement on Saturday”, then an extension might not be needed.
“But it’s too early to make that assessment at this stage,” he said.

Running out of road
Boris Johnson is in a race against the clock to secure a fresh agreement for the meeting of European leaders starting in Brussels on Thursday.
After meeting the European Council’s president-elect Charles Michel, Finland’s Antti Rinne said there was “no time” for the UK prime minister to achieve an agreement.
But housing secretary Robert Jenrick rejected the remarks, stressing a “great deal” of progress had been made and negotiators are working “very intensively”.
He toldBBC’s Newsnight: “The EU is capable of moving extremely quickly if they wish to. Like any negotiation with the EU, and in fact with any major negotiation in life, everything happens at the last minute.
Rinne’s comments came as negotiators stepped up efforts to work out a way to break the deadlock over the Irish backstop.
“I think there is no time in a practical or legal way to find an agreement before the EU Council meeting. We need more time,” Rinne said during a Helsinki press conference,according to Reuters.
Speaking to reportersin Brussels this morning, Barnier said the work has been “intense”.
He said even though it is getting “more and more difficult”, a deal is possible this week.
“Obviously, any agreement must work for everyone, all of the United Kingdom and the whole of the European Union.”

Here in Ireland, the Taoiseach and Tanaiste will brief cabinet today on the state of play in Brexit, including last week’s meeting with Johnson.
Negotiations are continuing this week between the task force and the UK, but a source said that there are still major hurdles to overcome and “no one should underestimate the scale of the challenge to secure agreement and redraft a treaty in time for the European Council”.
‘We’re not there yet’
A Cabinet briefing on Brexit was understood to have been postponed by Johnson as negotiators continued talks to hammer out a new deal ahead of the 31 October deadline.
Today’s planned update to senior ministers was said to have been delayed until tomorrow so he can give more detailed information on efforts to strike a new agreement.
Related Reads7 in 10 people in Ireland don't think a Brexit deal will be reached by the end of the week
The prime minister has been under increasing pressure to concede greater ground to Brussels, with reports suggesting the UK has dropped a demand that a deal should include a veto for the Stormont Assembly on customs arrangements.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney raised some hopes by saying “a deal is possible”, maybe even this week, but stressed “we’re not there yet”.
In similar comments, Johnson told senior ministers there was “still a significant amount of work to get there” but a “pathway” to a deal was still visible.
Loophole
The two-day EU summit is crucial because the prime minister must get a new deal approved by MPs by Saturday if he is to avoid a clash over asking for a Brexit delay.
The Benn Act passed by MPs opposed to a no deal, including Tory rebels, says he must ask for an extension to Article 50 if MPs do not back a deal by then.
There are fears that a loophole could be used to avoid this, with Johnson repeatedly ruling out making the extension request under his “do or die” pledge to get Brexit done by the Halloween deadline.
Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg has suggested the government could use European law to achieve no deal.
“Theresa May got an extension not through UK law but through EU law and, until the 1972 European Communities Act is repealed, EU law is superior law in the UK,” he said onBBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour.
Labour has threatened court action to force the prime minister to obey the legislation.
Regardless of the outcome in Brussels, a showdown is anticipated in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday – the first in 37 years – if MPs approve the unusual move.
They will be able to back or reject any deal presented to them, or there will be discussions on what to do next in the Brexit saga.","7.33am, 15 Oct 2019",15 Oct 2019
https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-boris-house-of-commons-extension-vote-mps-letwin-4858451-Oct2019/,"BORIS JOHNSON HAS tried to distance himself from a legally required request for a Brexit extension by stressing to the EU it was sent at Parliament’s bidding.
After suffering an embarrassing defeat in the Commons over his Brexit plans, the Prime Minister got a senior diplomat to send an unsigned photocopy of the request by MPs to delay withdrawal from the EU.
In a second note to European Council president Donald Tusk, Johnson said a Brexit extension would be a mistake.
Tusk has confirmed he received the letter seeking an extension.
Mehreen / TwitterMehreen / Twitter/ Twitter
Tonight’s developments come after MPs in the House of Commons voted to force Johnson to seek the delay, throwing his plans to pass a Meaningful Vote on his new deal today and leave by 31 October into disarray.
The Letwin amendment, a cross-party bid to seek an extension in order to ensure legislation backing up the new deal is through the House before Brexit happens, was passed this afternoon by a margin of322 to 306.
That vote followed hours of debate as MPs convened for what was being billed by the UK media as ‘Super Saturday’. It was the first time parliament had been convened on a Saturday for 37 years.
The passing of the Letwin amendment meant that had today’s planned Meaningful Vote gone ahead it would have done so with the amendment, meaning an extension request would be required.
But the vote did not go ahead meaning the Benn Act, passed last month, still applies.
That legislation forced the government to request an extension from the EU if MPs had not approved a deal before midnight tonight Brussels time.
The letter has now been sent in spite of Johnson telling the Commons earlier:
An EU source said earlier that Tusk and Johnson had spoken by phone at 8.15pm Brussels time (7.15pm Irish time), and added: “The PM confirmed that the letter would be sent to Tusk today.

“Tusk will on that basis start consulting EU leaders on how to react. This may take a few days,” he added.
After receiving the letter Tusk later tweeted: “The extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.”
Meanwhile Johnson also called Taoiseach Leo Varadkar earlier to discuss the latest Westminster developments. No further details on that call were released.
The decision on whether to grant an extension will come down to the leaders of the remaining 27 EU nations, but it will be Tusk’s job as head of the European Council to gather their views and he could call a special summit to approve an extension.
Johnson said in his second letter tonight that he would be happy to attend the start of any such summit in order to progress the ratification process.
He added in that letter that a further delay would damage the interests of both the UK and the EU and said the process must be brought to a conclusion.
Earlier, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Prime Minister must comply with the Benn Act.
He said Johnson should “think very carefully” about his initial defiant comments in the wake of the amendment vote.
Other opposition party leaders also called on Johnson to comply with the Benn legislation and seek an extension.
Press AssociationPress Association
Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg announced in the Commons this afternoon that there will be another Meaningful Vote on Monday.
However, it remains unclear whether Speaker John Bercow will allow the motion or not. He told MPs he would rule on it on Monday.
How they voted
The voting took place as hundreds of thousands of protesters converged on central London in a People’s Vote campaign march in support of a second referendum.
The result was greeted by loud cheers by the crowd assembled outside the Palace of Westminster in Parliament Square.

The Government was consigned to defeat after the 10 MPs of the DUP joined the other opposition parties in voting for the amendment.
Ten former Conservative MPs who now sit as independents, including former cabinet ministers Ken Clarke, Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd, also backed the amendment.
Six Labour rebels voted against it.

European reaction
In the immediate aftermath of the vote on the amendment it became clear the EU was adopting a ‘wait and see’ approach.
The chief spokesperson for the European Commission tweeted earlier that it “takes note of the vote in the House of Commons today on the so-called #Letwin Amendment meaning that the #WithdrawalAgreement itself was not put to vote today. It will be for the UK government to inform us about the next steps as soon as possible.”
The Taoiseach said in a statement before tonight’s letters were sent: “The European Union and United Kingdom made a Withdrawal Agreement last Thursday that defends Ireland’s interests. The House of Commons voted today to defer a decision on whether or not to ratify that agreement.
“To date, no request for an extension has been made by the UK Government. Should that happen, President Tusk will consult with all 27 Heads of State & Government on whether or not we will grant one. An extension can only be granted by unanimity.”
Meanwhile the French government earlier said that a delay would be in “nobody’s interest”.
“An agreement has been negotiated. It is now up to the British parliament to say whether it accepts or rejects it,” the French presidency said.

WITH THE IRISH government warning a no-deal Brexit could push up the price of online shopping and inbound deliveries from the likes of Asos and Boohoo, there may be a silver lining for Irish retailers.
While Irish business might have an opportunity to gain back some market share, retail industry experts added that it won’t be easy.
According to David Curtin, the chief executive of IE Domain Registry, import tariffs and customs on UK goods bought online from the UK presents a huge opportunity for small to medium enterprises (SME).
Irish citizens spend around €12 billion a year online, with 60% of that going to international retailers and in particular the UK.
Curtin said SMEs that sell locally could offer a click-and-collect service to generate sales and footfall in store to win back sales.
“Consumers that buy online from these Irish SMEs can continue to avail of speedy delivery times and free return services that the UK’s exit from the digital single market will take away,” he said.
However, as it stands, Curtin said that few Irish businesses are taking the opportunity of going online.
The latest IE Domain Registry Digital Health Index showed that less than a third of all SMEs can take sale orders through their website, while fewer can process sales online.

Industry thoughts
According to Thomas Burke, the director of Retail Ireland, tariffs and customs tax on UK goods present a good opportunity for Irish retailers who are operating online to fill any gap that becomes available.
However, he added that there could be a challenge in terms of the sterling-euro exchange rate. According to Burke, if the exchange rate heads towards parity then the devaluation of sterling would mean that the price of sourcing goods from the UK would fall.
He added that Retail Ireland has seen “a real upping of the game” of Irish retailers in the last 12 to 18 months in the online space and Irish consumers increasingly choosing to shop these sites.
David Fitzsimons, the group chief executive of Retail Excellence, toldForathat he agrees there are opportunities for Irish retailers to take advantage of online sales. However, it’s not going to be easy, particularly in fashion, he added.

“The majority of Irish merchants who sell branded items source them in the UK and tariffs will be applied at a wholesale level there,” Fitzsimons said.
Some global brand agencies who distribute to Ireland often also bundle the clothes in with their UK deliveries, Fitzsimons said. This means Irish merchants would have to buy from a UK-based agent and pay tariffs on the goods – cancelling the price difference.
Fitzsimons said that it is a good idea to get online and added that retailers should look towards selling to the EU market which is worth €300 billion per year.
“There is big opportunity to carve out a bit of geography in Frankfurt or Dusseldorf market – have a local partner and sell into those markets where the population is vast,” he said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-non-paper-proposals-4832458-Oct2019/,"LATE ON TUESDAY, new proposals emerged for how Boris Johnson plans to replace the backstop.
The Daily Telegraphreported thenew details just over 24 hours after RTÉrevealedplans that the UK had proposed to the EU, which were widely rejected by politicians yesterday, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
The new proposals, which the paper said had been dubbed ‘two borders, for four years’, would see Northern Ireland leave the EU customs union alongside the UK, but would see it remain aligned on the rules of the single market for agriculture and industrial goods for four years.
According to the paper, a regulatory border will be created in the Irish sea. The proposal means that Northern Ireland will leave the customs union at the end of the transition period in 2021 alongside the rest of the UK, but customs checks will be required between the North and Ireland “set back from the border”, the Daily Telegraph reports.
Tánaiste Simon Coveney was quick to reject the proposal. He told the Tonight Show on Virgin Media One that “if the reports we are seeing are true, it doesn’t look like it’s the basis for an agreement”.

Speaking on RTÉ yesterday evening, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee also said that this latest plan would not be acceptable to the government.
“What we’re talking about is picking and choosing certain parts of the single market,” she said.
“If this is what is being proposed, it certainly won’t be acceptable,” she added. “Time is running out.”
“You’d really have to question if there’s a sincere effort to get a deal done,” Fianna Fáil’s Lisa Chambers also said on RTÉ last night.
The rejection will set up a difficult day for Boris Johnson, who will today give his keynote address to the Tory Party conference.
If these new proposals receive a frosty reception in Brussels, fears of a no-deal Brexit will grow. The swift rejection from senior Irish politicians last night suggests that the new plan is set to receive a similar fate to the one reported on Monday evening by RTÉ.
Before details of the plans were released, Johnsontold the BBCon Tuesday that the UK’s proposals were “good and creative”, “very constructive and far-reaching”.
The suggestions had raised some hopes that the proposal reported by RTÉ on Monday evening would arrive back to Brussels considerably updated.
Monday’s plans
The plans reported on Monday suggested in non-legal language that instead of the backstop ‘custom centres’ would be set up 5-10 miles back on either side of the border.
Goods crossing the border would need to be declared and cleared in these customs clearance sites; as they’re moved from the north clearance centre to the south or vice versa, it’s been proposed that technology would monitor the whereabouts of the goods in real-time, possibly via mobile phone GPS data or tracking devices fitted to vehicles.
In keeping with Boris Johnson’s previous statements, the non-papers proposed an all-island agri-zone, where Northern Ireland would be expected to abide by the EU’s animal and plant health rules and regulations.
Former attorney general Dominic Grieve said shortly after Johnson’s appointment as Prime Minister that he was concerned that he would talk about striking a deal but not put any proposals forward.

In the past two weeks, the EU has received four ‘non-paper’ proposals from the UK, with very little detail given on what is contained in these documents.

Non-Paper = Non-Starter. Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govt if a#Brexitdeal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!
Concerns with the proposals
A number of concerns had been immediately raised about the UK-EU proposals.
The focus on avoiding physical infrastructure at the border has given way to suggestions of hosting checks at the ‘point of origin’, or at business premises.
The possibility of “pop-up” checkpoints had also been floated around previously in the Irish media and by UK civil servants, as a way of avoiding physical infrastructure at the border.
This would not replace the backstop however, which suggests that Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK abide by the EU’s custom rules and regulations in order to avoid physical checks of any kind on the island of Ireland.
Physical checks away from the border boundary line wouldn’t solve the threat from dissidents either: any infrastructure would be viewed as a symbol of division on the island of Ireland, and ramp up security threats in Ireland.
Speaking to a UK Home Affairs committee earlier this month, Dr Andrew McCormick, a Permanent Secretary at the Executive Office Northern Ireland, questioned how checks away from the border would work from a policing and enforcement perspective:
The non-papers also suggested cherry-picking some elements of the EU’s sanitary and phytosanitary checks (which is rules on animal and plant health).
The backstop is an insurance policy that covers custom rules, SPS checks, manufactured goods and the movement of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
Through those measures, it aims to prevent a hard border, facilitate north-south cooperation, and protect the integrity of the EU’s Single Market.
Speaking in the Dáil, Leo Varadkar dismissed the proposals as being the same as no-deal checks.
He added that “there will be checks at the ports, at the airports, perhaps at business level, perhaps near the border too and that’s just the reality of the situation but that is in the context of no deal”.
Tuesday’s plans
The plans released on Tuesday night will lead the headlines and drive debate throughout today.
At a first glance, the proposals suggest that Boris Johnson has had considerable success in winning over the DUP, which had repeatedly rejected any suggestion of regulatory divergence between the North and the rest of the UK.
Appearing at the party’s event at the Conservative conference last night, he promised to deliver Brexit to a generally positive reception.
No one from the DUP has yet commented publicly on the proposals, but securing DUP support could indicate that the wider Conservative Party might be persuaded to back the plan.
While these are only leaked documents and the real proposal may differ, first reactions suggest that Johnson may have a more difficult job winning over EU leaders.

“However, not all regulated firms are adequately prepared. There is no excuse for this, even accepting that there remains considerable uncertainty. You owe all your stakeholders, including and most importantly your customers, a duty of care to ensure that you are prepared,” he said.
Sibley also told insurance firms that they need to take action to address the “risks, challenge and opportunities” of innovation and climate change.
“Too many of your firms are not getting the fundamentals right, with ineffective IT risk management practices, weaknesses in IT security, a lack of effective oversight of IT, and weaknesses in the management of outsourcing.”
He said he expects the industry to play a positive role in shaping the response to climate change risks.

Harris was briefing the Oireachtas Justice Committee this morning on reform within the gardaí and was asked about the potential impact of Brexit by a number of committee members.
The commissioner said gardaí have plans in place to deal with the impact of Brexit and have been liaising with the Department of Justice on the “legal issues that will open up”.
“Obviously a lot of the EU treaties that would have dealt with organised crime issues will fall away, so things around tracing financial assets, for instance, because the UK is leaving those arrangements,” he said in response to questions from Fianna Fáil’s Jim O’Callaghan.
“Overall I would say that we are ready, we have been thinking about this for two years and building up resources in the border area,” he added.

The commissioner said An Garda Síochána has already supplemented border county divisions with more gardaí and will likely do so again when more gardaí pass out in November.
Harris added that it is hoped that gardaí will add an armed support unit in Cavan “to reduce response times in the border area”.
“There’s been a big uplift in our capability and there’s more to come,” Harris said.
Fine Gael Senator Martin Conway also asked whether gardai were “expecting violence if there is a no-deal Brexit and we do see borders”.
“I’m not going to speculate on what the border infrastructure is going to be,” Harris responded.

“I’m responsible for providing a policing service to protect society and to protect other agencies, we operate very much against the threat of both smuggling and other organised crime based on an intelligence-based response in focused operations and that’s where I would envisage this will further develop.”

https://www.thejournal.ie/us-free-trade-agreement-uk-brexit-4756937-Aug2019/,"THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION will pursue a free-trade agreement with Britain as soon as possible after it leaves the EU, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said.
He made the comments as the UK’s new foreign secretary Dominic Raab made his first official visit to the US.
Speaking at a news conference with Raab, Pompeo said the Trump administration remains committed to respecting whatever Britain’s final decision on Brexit is and is eager to conclude a trade deal.
“We support the United Kingdom’s sovereign choice, however Brexit ultimately shakes out and we’ll be on the doorstep, pen in hand, ready to sign a new free trade agreement at the earliest possible time,” Pompeo said.
Raab said Johnson and his Cabinet are “absolutely resolved, determined” to leave the EU at the end of October with or without a deal to soften its effects.
He said he hoped to conclude a new trade deal with the US “as soon as possible after we leave the EU on October 31.”
After his first phone call with Johnson, Trump told reporters that a bilateral deal with post-Brexit Britain could be “three to four, five times” bigger than current trade and once London is out of the European Union “we could do much more”.
“We’re working on a trade agreement already,” Trump said. “I think it will be a very substantial trade agreement.”
Trump’s apparent enthusiasm for a deal is in marked contrast to the attitude of his predecessor Barack Obama, who said that Britain would be at the “back of the queue” for any kind of trade deal if it left the EU.

Last year, the US ran a $20 billion trade surplus with Britain.
The two countries exchanged $262 billion in goods and services, according to the US Trade Representative’s office, meaning Britain was America’s fifth-largest export market.
Top US exports are financial services and aircraft while British exports include autos and tourism.
Risk of no-deal growing
Meanwhile, Finance and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe said yesterday the risk of a no-deal Brexit is growing but that such a scenario can still be avoided.
Made his comments in London, where he met new British chancellor Sajid Javid on Tuesday.
Speaking onRTÉ Radio 1′s Morning Ireland, Donohoe said both men used the meeting to reiterate their respective governments’ positions.
Donohoe said Javid is “absolutely committed” to Britain leaving the European Union by the current deadline of 31 October.
He said he told Javid that the Irish government remains committed to thebackstop elementof the Withdrawal Agreement, describing it as “the best possible insurance policy for all of the risks that we may need to deal with in the future”.

https://www.thejournal.ie/andrew-adonis-boris-johnson-brexit-4731340-Jul2019/,"LORD ANDREW ADONIS has said that Boris Johnson’s election as leader of the Conservatives and the next British Prime Minister will be “the last throw of the Brexit dice”.
Ahead of a talk entitled ‘Why Brexit can still be stopped’ he’s to give at the Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin today at 1pm, the Labour politician spoke toTheJournal.ieabout Boris Johnson, the backstop and Northern Ireland.
So, what does he want to tell Irish people?
“My big message is don’t panic, Boris Johnson [being elected as Prime Minister] is the last throw of the Brexit dice and it’s almost inconceivable that it’s going to be a double-six.”
A double-six roll in this metaphor, according to Adonis, is scrapping Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement and starting fresh negotiations with the EU which don’t involve the Irish backstop or having to make any substantial ‘divorce’ payments.
The EU has said previously that it will not begin negotiating a free trade deal until three key issues are secured with the UK: the divorce bill (which stands at £39 billion in the Withdrawal Agreement); EU citizens rights, and the Northern Ireland border.
Adonis said that Johnson becoming Prime Minister wouldn’t change the options available: there’s still no majority in the House of Commons for a no-deal Brexit, which would necessitate a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.
“Boris is a showman seeking to win the Conservatives over… It’s pure fantasy otherwise, the Tory grassroots [are the ones most] in favour of Brexit.”

Whoops!We couldn't find this Tweet
On the issue of the backstop, Adonis said that “it’s entirely a matter for Britain whether it applies to Northern Ireland or just Ireland”.
The backstop ensures that if a future trade deal means there are widely different customs rules and standards, that Northern Ireland’s regulations will be in line with the EU’s, ensuring there is no need for checks at the border.
In order to ensure the DUP and unionists didn’t feel the union was under threat because of this, May decided to extend the backstop to the whole of the UK.
“Theresa May’s decision to extend the backstop to make it UK-wide worsened [her situation],” Adonis said.
So should the backstop be applied to just Northern Ireland again, which the Taoiseach said this week was an option that was “always on the table”?
He said that this week’s vote compelling Parliament to sit in October, was a “crucially important development”as “it will almost certainly rule out a no-deal”.
“We will end up with a further extension in October and possibly a referendum or election after that.”

But it’s also something that can fall foul of bad explanations, misunderstandings, and being used as a political football.
So this week on The Explainer podcast, we’re taking a good and proper look at the Backstop. What is it? Why is it so controversial? Is everything that’s being said about it true?

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-no-deal-4854806-Oct2019/,"LAST UPDATE|17 Oct 2019
THE DUP HAS confirmed it will vote against the Brexit deal agreed between the UK and the EU when it goes before the House of Commons on Saturday.
The party said the proposals “undermine the integrity of the union”, citing problems on issues such as customs, consent and VAT.
The party had earlier this morning said it was opposed to the proposed agreement and after adeal was announced by the EU and UK this afternoonit confirmed its opposition.
The deal contains various changes to the deal previously agreed by Theresa May’s government, essentially amending the backstop so that it applies specifically to Northern Ireland and not the UK as a whole.
The deal lays out that the mechanism would then be reviewed by Northern Ireland’s  Assembly after four years, allowing it to decided by a simple majority whether to continue or not with the customs and regulatory arrangements.

In a statement this afternoon, the DUP said it could not support this.
“The Democratic Unionist Party has worked since the referendum result to secure a negotiated deal as we leave the European Union. We have been consistent that we will only ever consider supporting arrangements that are in Northern Ireland’s long-term economic and constitutional interests and protect the integrity of the union.
On the issue of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s place in the deal, the DUP is opposed to the proposal that a simple majority could make a decision, rather than requiring a majority of both nationalists and unionists.
“While some progress has been made in recognising the issue of consent, the elected representatives of Northern Ireland will have no say on whether Northern Ireland should enter these arrangements,” the DUP says.
“These arrangements will become the settled position in these areas for Northern Ireland. This drives a coach and horses through the professed sanctity of the Belfast Agreement.”

The DUP’s rejection of the deal significantly hurts the chances that it will be approved by the UK parliament on Saturday.
The House of Commons will sit on a weekend for the first time in almost four decades and MPs will now have a deal to vote on.
Boris Johnson’s government does not have majority support in parliament and relies on the support of the DUP as part of a confidence and supply deal.
Hardline Tory Brexiteers from the European Research Group (ERG) have expressed support for the deal with Jacob Rees-Mogg MP describing it in parliament as “an incredible achievement”
“In 85 days the undemocratic backstop has been removed, at the end of transition period, that is to say 31 December 2020 we will no longer be under the imperial yolk of the European Union,” he said.

The sterling closed at €1.1058 last night, dropping below €1.10 followingreports this morning that the House of Commons would be proroguedfrom September.
The move makes it more difficult for MPs to block a no-deal Brexit, meaning that such a scenario is now more likely on 31 October.

In a letter to MPs this morning, Johnson said the current parliamentary session needed to come to a close.
He said he would schedule a Queen’s Speech – laying out the government’s plans – to launch new legislation on 14 October, less than three weeks before Brexit.
He denied that the move was an attempt to block MPs from discussing Brexit, saying MPs would have “ample time” to debate the issue.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brexit-britain-cameron-johnson-4810341-Sep2019/,"The Sunday TimesThe Sunday Times
BREXIT AGAIN DOMINATES the Sunday papers in the UK today, with two distinct strands featuring former prime minister David Cameron taking a dig at the Brexiteers in extracts from his book and current prime minister Boris Johnson comparing Britain to the Incredible Hulk.
Cameron, who’s stayed largely quiet since his resignation following the 2016 Brexit vote, has featured prominently in the media in the last week as he attempts to plug his memoirs which will be published next week.
In extracts published in the Sunday Times, Cameron said that Johnson believed that campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union during the 2016 referendum would make him the “darling” of their Conservative party.
He also claimed that Johnson privately believed there should be a second referendum to confirm the terms of Brexit – something the premier has strongly resisted since.
Cameron also accused the Leave campaign of lying to the public, describing Johnson and his close ally Michael Gove of becoming “ambassadors for the expert-trashing, truth-twisting age of populism” during the campaign.
The publication comes at a turbulent time for the UK, with the Brexit deadline of 31 October looming closer.
In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Johnson said his team was making a “huge amount of progress” in the talks and he was “very confident” he could get a deal before a summit of EU leaders on 17 October.
Mail on SundayMail on Sunday
This is despite Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney, Michel Barnier and others saying this week that little progress had been made, and the EU and the UK remained very far apart when it came to negotiations.
And, in a bizarre analogy, Johnson compared Britain to the comic book character Hulk.
“The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets and he always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be – and that is the case for this country,” he said.

Without a deal, Johnson insists Britain will leave the EU anyway – despite a law rushed through last week in the House of Commons to force him to delay.
The prime minister is due to meet European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and Barnier in Luxembourg tomorrow.
‘Leave was lying’
Elsewhere in the extracts from Cameron’s memoir, the former PM revealed he had tried to stop Johnson from joining the Brexit campaign by offering him the post of defence secretary.
But he went ahead, and “risked an outcome he didn’t believe in because it would help his political career”.
He claimed Johnson believed the “Leave” camp would lose, and if it won “there could always be a fresh renegotiation, followed by a second referendum” – something he now rejects.
Meanwhile, “whichever senior Tory politician took the lead on the Brexit side — so loaded with images of patriotism, independence and romance – would become the darling of the party,” Cameron wrote.
During the campaign, he said Johnson and Gove “behaved appallingly, attacking their own government, turning a blind eye to their side’s unpleasant actions and becoming ambassadors for the expert-trashing, truth-twisting age of populism”.
Cameron condemned claims made by the “Leave” campaign of the savings Britain would make by ending its EU membership fees, and of the likelihood of Turkey joining the bloc.
“We were no longer in the realms of stretching the truth, but ditching it altogether. Leave was lying,” he wrote.
He said Gove became a “foam-flecked Faragist warning that the entire Turkish population was about to come to Britain”, a reference to eurosceptic politician Nigel Farage.
Cameron said that as prime minister, he felt he could not hit back as hard, resulting in “asymmetric warfare”.

EARLIER THIS WEEK, a UK Tribunalruledthat people born in Northern Ireland cannot self-identify as Irish citizens only – without revoking their British citizenship first.
It was the latest finding in a case involving the Home Office and Derry woman Emma DeSouza, who is seeking a residence card for her US-born husband.
DeSouza, who identifies as Irish and is an Irish citizen, made her application on those grounds. She brought a case against the Home Office after it rejected her application because it considered her a British citizen.
However, she believes that the Home Office’s position is against the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, which gives anyone from the North the right to identify as British, Irish, or both.
The ruling led to a claim by Sinn Féin that the British government are taking away citizenship rights from those in the North. But is that accurate?
On Tuesday morning, Sinn Féin’s official Twitter account – which has almost 100,000 followers –posted a tweetand accompanying video referring to the DeSouza ruling.
It said:
Twitter / Sinn FéinTwitter / Sinn Féin/ Sinn Féin
The 36-second video repeated the claim, alongside images of British Home Secretary Priti Patel, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and excerpts from the Good Friday Agreement.
It said: “The British Govt [sic] are removing your right to Irish citizenship, ruling that everyone in the North is British, directly attacking the 1998 [Good Friday] Agreement.”
The video also called on viewers to “defend your right to be Irish”.

By the time of writing, the post had more than 1,400 retweets and 2,000 ‘likes’ and the accompanying video had been watched more than 120,000 times.
On Monday, the UK’S Upper Tribunal ruled that people born in Northern Ireland cannot self-identify as Irish citizens only, without revoking their British citizenship first.
The ruling essentially means that those born in Northern Ireland are automatically seen as British citizens in the eyes of the law when they are born.
It does not change citizenship rights for those born in the North; rather, it clarifies that citizens of Northern Ireland are born British and can only become Irish after renouncing their British citizenship.
The judges stated that to do so, citizens can undergo a formal process which costs £200.
The rulingoverturned a previous decision made by the First-Tier Tribunal in DeSouza’s favour, which found that immigration laws laid out in the British Nationality Act 1981 were superseded by the Good Friday Agreement.
Under Article 1 (iv)/(vi) of the Good Friday Agreement, “the birthright of all the people of Northern Irelandto identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship” is recognised by both the Irish and British governments.
But appealing the First-Tier Tribunal ruling, lawyers for the Home Office claimed that provisions on citizenship outlined in the Agreement had not been incorporated into the UK’s corresponding domestic legislation linked to it, the 1998 Northern Ireland Act.
As a result, they were successfully able to argue that an international treaty doesn’t overpower British immigration law.
The Tribunal ruled that it would infringe parliamentary sovereignty if the British government could enter into a treaty with a foreign state – in this case, Ireland – and change the domestic law of the UK without consulting parliament first.
It therefore found that immigration laws set out under the British Nationality Act do not supersede those in the Good Friday Agreement.
Upper TribunalUpper Tribunal
However, during the case, the Home Office accepted that citizens in the North could identify as British or Irish, or both during the Tribunal hearing.
It was only their legal argument that this right does right not make individuals who are born in the North legal citizens of their own choosing.
Related ReadsFactCheck: A reader's guide to how it works
In a statement toTheJournal.ieafter the ruling, the Home Office reiterated its commitment to upholding the Good Friday Agreement, as well as its acceptance of the right of those in the North to identify as Irish citizens.
“We respect the right of the people of Northern Ireland to choose to identify as British or Irish or both and their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship,” it said.
TheJournal.iemade multiple attempts to contact Sinn Féin to clarify the claim in the party’s tweet, but no response was received by the time of publication.
The British government has not removed the right to Irish citizenship from those in the North.
The Upper Tribunal ruling found that citizens in the North are automatically British citizens, but its ruling did not take away their right to become Irish citizens.
Both the Home Office and the Upper Tribunal still accept that citizens in the North can become Irish citizens under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.
It is simply untrue to suggest the British government is removing this right or defying the Good Friday Agreement.

https://www.thejournal.ie/micheal-martin-boris-johnson-4736796-Jul2019/,"THE ACCESSION OF Boris Johnson to Downing Street “quite rightly raises enormous fears”, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin told an audience in Glenties, Donegal this evening.
Speaking at the MacGill Summer School, he said his election as the new Tory leader, and the new UK prime minister raises fears for the future of relations between the governments and also London’s policy towards Northern Ireland.
“I wish Boris Johnson well in his capacity as British prime minister. Tomorrow, we assume he will be,” he said.
Martin said that when Johnson visited Ireland, he did not show the level of knowledge one would expect from someone in his position.
Boris’ trip to Dublin
“Anyone in Dublin who met him during his time as Foreign Secretary will tell you the many ways in which he failed to show the slightest level of understanding about the operations of the Good Friday Agreement or the deep problems raised by Brexit.
“It is clear that he is single-minded in his ambition, but I don’t think anyone can credibly say that he has thought-through how to promote prosperity and reconciliation in Northern Ireland,” said Martin.
He added:
Borris Johnson and Tánaiste Simon Coveney in Dublin in 2017.Sam BoalSam Boal
When asked if Johnson has lot of work to do catching up on Northern Ireland issues, Martin replied:
I think he has.
“When we met last year there was a sense that he was glossing over the realities of the potential negative of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement, on relationships North and South that had developed over 20 odd years. So, he seemed to push them to one side as if they weren’t an issue,” said the Fianna Fáil leader.
“He has consistently, in my view, understated the impact of Brexit on North/South relations and on the island of Ireland.
“So I think he needs to bring himself up to date very quickly in terms of what is required actually to sustain the sets of relationships on this island.
He said the Good Friday Agreement has three sets of relationships – the British/Irish relationship, the North/South and the relationship between both communities in the North.
“It took a lot of work to get there and I think he perhaps to date, maybe for reasons that suit his purpose in terms of Brexit, but I think he’s understated the impact of Brexit potentially on that agreement, but more importantly on the sets of relationships that underpin that agreement.”

Martin said Johnson appears to have skills to adapt, and he hopes this is the case with his succession into the top job.
“People would say he was an effective mayor of London. But to get elected as mayor of London, which actually for a conservative was a difficult proposition, but that he skillfully managed to do that, and then he moved to a liberal, environmentally conscious, conservative middle ground that enabled him to win that election.
Even when he was President of the Oxford Union, Martin said Johnson again moved to the centre ground.
Holding on to hope
“I’m giving that as a potential hopeful sign, when he sees the realities of what’s before him, in terms of the engagement with the European Union, the realities of Brexit – there is no percentage in it for the UK in terms of a no-deal Brexit, or indeed for anybody, and that his own self interest and the interests of his party and government will be bound up in arriving at a common sense appraisal of the challenge that Brexit presents to him.”
In addition, Martin said that the potential narrowing majority in Westminster could bring forward the prospect of a UK general election.
“That in itself may have an impact on the timetable around Brexit,” he added.
“We need to spend now until October 31st focused on ensuring that we can arrive at a situation that doesn’t damage the economic livelihoods of people on this island, or across Europe, or indeed within the UK,” said Martin.
However, Martin said “in spite of all of this, and the trepidation rightly felt by people who want to protect the achievements of the peace settlement, we must find a way to work with Boris Johnson”.

Varadkar needs to meet Boris within weeks
He said that over the next few weeks the Taoiseach and UK Prime Minister will meet to discuss Brexit. Though nothing is on the schedule just yet, government sources state that the Taoiseach to engage earlier rather than later with Johnson.
“Both leaders should be reminded that this is not just a game of one upmanship –that Brexit is far too serious to play domestic politics with,” Martin said this evening.
“It would be a good start if there was an end to the new habit of carrying out every disagreement in public and for both the Taoiseach and the new Prime Minister to do more than focus on the fight at hand,” he added.
He said Johnson “has boxed himself into a corner. But I think the defining feature of his career to date has been either through self interest or in terms of analysing the set of circumstances facing him, he has managed to adapt and change course”.
Bad relations with the UK
Speaking about an issue he has touched on before, Martin said the deteriorating relationship between the two countries is very concerning.
He said “deep and permanent contact and cooperation post Brexit” must be maintained.
“This can’t just be holding a few more meetings of existing bodies – we need a permanent secretariat and formal engagement across all of the issues which we formerly dealt with in the EU.
“There is too much at stake for our two islands – not just economically but socially and politically as well,” he said, adding:
Martin also used his speech to state, yet again, that it is a “scandal” that the Northern Ireland institutions are not up and running.
“For years, in every single piece of published research, the people of Northern Ireland have said they want a focus on the practical problems they face in relation to finding good jobs, a health service under pressure and entrenched disadvantage – yet even when they were operating the devolved institutions were seen as focusing on a different agenda.
He said there “needs to be a new agenda, focused on practical problems – with the need for a new economic model for Northern Ireland by far the most important… We need to abandon the constant fight to manage decline and replace it with initiatives which recognise the unique economic problems faced by Northern Ireland and the Border region as a whole”.
Marriage equality in Northern Ireland
When asked if the issue of marriage equality isn’t a practical issue to some, Martin said the focus “has to be on the practical issues apart from the constitutional issues”.
“This whole idea that Brexit happened, Sinn Fein came forward with the idea of a border poll and everything has to be about the constitutional status of Northern Ireland when in fact, in many respects the people of Northern Ireland have moved on and want real focus on bread and butter issues, on their health service, on education issues…”.
In his view, had the institutions in the North not collapsed, marriage equality would already be on the statute books in Northern Ireland.
“Marriage equality, yes I think there is a majority in Northern Ireland for marriage equality. The recent developments in Westminster, I think will bring that closer. In fact, I think if the assembly was brought back there is every chance you would have marriage equality,” he said, adding that he does not think the petition of concern would have been used to block the passage of marriage equality.
“I sense having spoken to unionists is that if there had been an Assembly over the last two years we might have seen marriage equality come onto the statute books in the North independent of Westminster. That is a view that would be disputed by Sinn Féin and others, but actually I am not so sure the petitions of concern would have been evoked as was feared because I think there is a certain element in unionism that believe they have to move on these particular issues.”
He said with Westminster now taking the lead on the issue, he believes there will be progress.
Martin said people in the North are “fed up of the non-show of the politicians in the Assembly and the Executive”.
“It was palpable and obviously the background of Lyra McKee’s murder was there as well. I think it is a scandal that the executive isn’t up and running when Northern Ireland is facing the threat that it is and I simply can’t comprehend it.
Martin was due to be speaking on a panel with Northern Ireland’s Sinn Féin leader Michelle O’Neill, but she cancelled her appearance tonight.
“I am disappointed. My understanding is that Michelle O’Neill won’t be here this evening, this is the second year in a row that I was billed, and I was to be sharing a platform with Michelle O’Neill and for some reason, the Northern Ireland Sinn Fein leader is pulled again and these are issues id like to discuss and engage on on a public platform and that is disappointing,” he said.
The Fianna Fáil leader also addressed the possible imminent threat of a no-deal Brexit.
If a no-deal situation is avoided, enormous challenges about the future of relations and progress on this island remains, said Martin.
“Today is a day where we all have every right to be worried about what will happen next – but equally we have an obligation to focus on those things which we know must be done.
“If we return to the spirit which delivered the peace settlement; if we can develop a political agenda which reflect the reality of today’s society in Northern Ireland; if we can restore basic working relations between the political leaders of our governments. If we can do these things, then we can get through this dangerous period and return to progress.

https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/katy-hayward-column-johnsons-letter-to-tusk-4775395-Aug2019/,"IF THE CORRESPONDENCE between the British prime minister and the head of the European Council was never terribly warm, we have now reached the stage of kiss-offs by open letter.
Johnson has written to Donald Tuskto tell him exactly why it is that he wants the backstop removed – and in doing so, he is demonstrating that the EU is dealing with a very different type of British prime minister.
That said, parts of his letter have been repeated often since his predecessor, Theresa May, first wrote to Tusk on 29 March 2017.
Johnson acknowledges that the UK and Ireland share “uniquely deep ties”. He reiterates that the British government is “unconditionally committed to the spirit and letter” of its obligations under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
The principles of the 1998 agreement underpin the peace process. They have transformed the British/Irish, north/south and unionist/nationalist relationships, and these relationships are increasingly under pressure in the tortuous, cantankerous process of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
This is the circle that Johnson has to square if he is intent on a hard Brexit that doesn’t throw Northern Ireland into the soup.
How he is planning to do this, according to this letter, is not in a way that many would have expected. That is: Johnson is now expressing a certain sense of patronage over the Agreement.
Building on this theme, Johnson’s primary objection to the backstop here is that it is “anti-democratic”. The argument goes that if Northern Ireland is to follow EU rules without being involved in making those rules, then its democratic oversight of EU policy-making is drastically curtailed.
This is not a new argument. Unsurprisingly, people from all political hues in Northern Ireland, being those most affected, have expressed concern. Indeed, Sinn Féin has long been lobbying to have MEP representation for Northern Ireland post-Brexit.

It is rather doubtful that if they were to be successful in this venture, the UK government would change its opinion about the backstop. The argument is one of principle as much as practice.
His second argument is that the backstop is inconsistent with the UK’s planned future relationship with the EU, which could be best described as friendly but distant.
‘Detached’
He says that the backstop would see the UK aligned to the customs union, and to the same rules of the single market, as would apply in Northern Ireland to avoid the need for border checks and controls. The alternative would be to see “Northern Ireland gradually detached from the UK economy across a very broad range of areas”.
This is not accurate – the rules that Northern Ireland would be aligned to in order to avoid checks are very specific ones.
Of all the rules that are contained in the single market, the indicative list of rules that would apply to Northern Ireland is less than 50 items long – and the checks would only be on one side i.e. from Great Britain entering Northern Ireland.
The volume of trade between the two in the areas most affected by these rules, plus the fact that this trade has to come through sea ports immediately, makes the means of handling these checks more straightforward.
The capacity for infrastructure and efficiency is there in a way that it is simply not at the land border.
Whether this is more significant for the integrity of the union than, say, having different rules and regimes around education, abortion, welfare or corporation tax rates is a political judgement rather than a legal one.
It is significant, therefore, that Johnson is framing such checks as being a matter of national sovereignty and constitutional integrity, thus upping the stakes for all concerned, especially unionists.
A more important point, however, is that this argument assumes that the backstop would be in play against a background of no UK-EU agreement.

Even a minimal trade agreement would cover many of the areas that the backstop would cover and, in so doing, it would reduce the UK/EU divergence that would give rise to the need for checks.
‘Delicate balance’
Thirdly, Johnson claims that the backstop puts the “delicate balance” achieved by the 1998 Agreement at risk. Although he doesn’t say what this balance is, he says that it would be undermined by the mere fact of “removing control of such large areas of the commercial and economy life of Northern Ireland to an external body”.
The language is again dramatic and it diverts attention from what is actually in the protocol itself.
The Withdrawal Agreement contains mechanisms by which the UK and the EU would jointly monitor the implementation of the backstop. There is a Joint Consultative Working Group, which would be a substantial forum through which Northern Ireland could have a say over what is working and what needs to be addressed.
Of course, inadequacies in the representation of Northern Ireland’s residents, at decision-making level in both Stormont and Westminster, adds a certain irony to theseclaims of concern for its future democratic representation in Brussels, in a possible scenario years from now.
Risking the hardest of borders in order to protect the 1998 Agreement is now what both sides are purporting to be doing.
The not insignificant difference, of course, is that the EU is still willing to consider the option of ‘no Brexit’ whereas for Johnson, Brexit is already past the point of no return.

https://www.thejournal.ie/simon-coveney-no-deal-brexit-4714973-Jul2019/,"TÁNAISTE SIMON COVENEY has warned that the chances of a disorderly Brexit have never been higher and the Government now considered the risk of this outcome on 31 October as “significant”.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs said he will bring a detailed update on the government’s contingency planning across all departments and State agencies to Cabinet tomorrow.
Once agreed by Cabinet, Coveney said the documents will be laid before the Oireachtas and published in full ahead of a Dáil debate on Brexit preparations later this week.
The updated contingency action plan is to build on the contingency plan published last December and the legislation passed by the Oireachtas in March.
Writing in the Irish Times this morning, Coveney said there has been to some inaccurate utterances about ourselves, the EU and the backstop recently.
“Of course people can have their own opinions, but they cannot have their own facts.
“The facts are that Brexit is a British decision, triggering article 50 on March 29th, 2017, was a British decision, and the red lines laid down for the negotiation are British red lines.

“We hope sensible evidence-based politics prevails over slogans in the UK, but we cannot bank on that,” he said.
Both the candidates in the race to replace Theresa May as Prime Minister – Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson – have said they would be prepared to leave the EU without a deal.
Serious error
Coveney went on to say that the biggest danger Ireland faces is assuming that a disorderly Brexit will be averted in October.”To assume this would be a serious error.”
The former head of the UK’s Brexit department echoed Coveney’s sentiment tellingBBC’s Panoramathat everyone should worry about no deal.
Philip Rycroft said the planning operation for exiting the EU was “an unprecedented situation” and “the biggest exercise across government over the last few decades”.
Rycroft, who had been in charge of preparing the UK for a no-deal Brexit until March, said a no-deal would be “a very abrupt change to our major trading relationship.”
No-deal planning work with the European Commission will continue in the coming weeks, Coveney said, to achieve the shared twin goals of preventing a hard Border while also protecting the EU’s single market.
“The State’s number one contingency is, and will remain, our EU membership, with all of the support and security that brings,” the Tánaiste said.

https://www.thejournal.ie/mps-vote-to-force-uk-government-to-disclose-no-deal-planning-and-communications-relating-to-prorogation-4802390-Sep2019/,"BRITISH MPS HAVE backed a motion requiring the release of no-deal planning documents and documents relating to the suspension of parliament.
In a vote this evening, the motion was passed 311 votes to 302 – a majority of nine.
The motion, put forward by Dominic Grieve who lost the Conservative Party whip last week, requires the release of all internal communications, including with Boris Johnson’s controversial adviser Dominic Cummings.
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said in the Commons prior to the vote that he has already said that the government intends to plan a version of its Operation Yellowhammer report on no-deal planning.

But it is neither an impact assessment or a worst-case scenario, Gove added.
The report, prepared by the UK cabinet, was leaked late last month.
Johnson is expected to try again to force a 15 October general election later this evening– but the move, once again, is likely to be blocked by the opposition.
The bill aimed at averting a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, meanwhile, is due to receive royal assent – become law.
Parliament will be prorogued – suspended – either this evening or tomorrow, the UK government has confirmed.

https://www.thejournal.ie/brendan-cox-interview-bbc-breakfast-4825345-Sep2019/,"LAST UPDATE|26 Sep 2019
UK PRIME MINISTER Boris Johnson has refused to apologise for comments he made last night when he said the best way to “honour the memory” of murdered MP Jo Cox would be “to get Brexit done”.
Johnson has come in for criticism today amid calls for him to help restrain the use of inflammatory language in the House of Commons.
House Speaker John Bercow said today that theatmosphere in the chamber last nightwas “worse than any I’ve known in my 22 years in the house”. He pleaded with parliamentarians on all sides to tackle the “toxic” political culture.
Johnson ignored questions from journalists as he left a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers this morning and Downing Street declined to say sorry for his words in the Commons.
Brendan Cox, the widower of murdered MP Jo Cox, was among those to plead for greater civility in political debate after her name was mentioned several times last night.
Cox said the Brexit debate has descended into a “bear pit of polarisation” that is “dangerous” for the UK.
Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered by afar-right extremist a week before the Brexit vote in 2016. She had been a remain supporter.
Johnson had been responding to a number of opposition MPs who asked him to moderate his language so as not to ‘whip up’ threats and intimidation against members.
Johnson has repeatedly used the terms ‘Surrender Act’ and ‘Capitulation Act’ when referring to the Benn Act. This Act seeks to force the UK government to seek a Brexit extension to avoid a no-deal.

Several MPs asked Johnson to refrain from using such language with Tracy Brabin MP, who succeeded Cox in her former constituency, saying that members should “feel secure when we’re going about our jobs”.
In response, Johnson said: “What I will say is that the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.”
Johnson also responded by saying “humbug” when Paula Sherriff MP said that his words have been quoted in death threats to members.
It is understood that Johnson is not minded to change his language in relation to the Benn Act. One Downing Street insider told the Press Association:
Johnson came in for criticism from several UK politicians yesterday evening with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn today saying that his language was “indistinguishable from the far right”.
The Prime Minister’s sister Rachel Johnson, a Change UK candidate in the recent European elections,today called her brother’s remarks “tasteless”.

“I think it was particularly tasteless for those who are grieving a mother, MP and friend to say the best way to honour her memory is to deliver the thing she and her family campaigned against — Brexit,” Rachel Johnson said.
She added that a lot of the heated rhetoric around Brexit “was initiated in the tabloids”, citing headlines condemning as “saboteurs” MPs who opposed leaving the EU, and judges who found against the government as “enemies of the people”.
Almost immediately after his wife’s name was used in the House of Commons last night, Brendan Cox called for more civility.
“Feel a bit sick at Jo’s name being used in this way. The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common,” he tweeted.
Today, Brendan Coxtold the BBC in an interview:
“It takes a fair amount to shock me now, but I think I was genuinely shocked by the willingness to descend to vitriol and the type of language that was used, because I think it does long-lasting harm.”
He spoke of threats to MPs and how some of them fear for their own safety as “the death threats … are still coming”.
“But I think the bigger damage is just to the tone of our politics – to have to this debate descend into this bear pit of polarisation, I think is dangerous for our country.”

He went on:
“I think this is something that is really important, that there is a willingness to jump out and decry the other side when they use language like ‘surrender’ or ‘traitor’ or ‘betrayal’ and I think that is inflammatory language. And I think as inflammatory are the people who have used the language of it being a coup and a dictatorship and fascism, which is often thrown at people who frankly people just disagree with. And I think both of those approaches are unacceptable.”
He added that “it’s not just bad behaviour by one side of the debate, this is something which has infected our politics and it’s this vicious cycle where language gets more extreme, response gets more extreme, it all gets hyped up”.
Conference
There was further bad news for Johnson this afternoon after MPs voted against a three-day suspension of the house next week to allow for Johnson’s Conservative Party to h0old their annual conference.
It represents the seventh successive House of Commons defeat for Johnson’s government, which no longer holds a majority.
The conference is expected to go ahead regardless.
