I was wrong,
The old saying rings through. Be carful what you wish for.
To that end,
I think for Europe an absent UK is sad, but for a Divided UK absent of Europe is more sad.
The irony of history, the British changed the course of history by sheer luck and determination make no mistake luck was very much on there side.
They helped reshape Europe, and repel Fascism, Europe is by no means free of its political problems and far right ideology’s. I hope one day Europe will be More European Than nationalistic, however nations and cultures are as individual as eye colour.
I’m not a fan of the British system but like the majority of the British people I’ve met in my lifetime. A British system which caused so much pain and suffering breaking nationalism across its colonies.
However our histories are what binds us, good, bad, & indifference. Ireland has been treated as subservient in the British Subjects mind since those days of colonialism.
Briton has been active and successful writing It’s own version of history, a kind of propaganda propagated at the highest levels.
A history of untruths, a doctrine thought to its children for decades. This doctrine is now the destabilising force which will leave its people bitter and angry for decades to come.

The agreement covers not just trade in goods and services, but also a broad range of other areas in the EU’s interest, such as investment, competition, State aid, tax transparency, air and road transport, energy and sustainability, fisheries, data protection, and social security coordination.
It provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin.
Both parties have committed to ensuring a robust level playing field by maintaining high levels of protection in areas such as environmental protection, the fight against climate change and carbon pricing, social and labour rights, tax transparency and State aid, with effective, domestic enforcement, a binding dispute settlement mechanism and the possibility for both parties to take remedial measures.

But what if such goods have come from the Republic of Ireland, or they move in the opposite direction? Some form of checks will be needed, and you’d then need a land border instead.
Johnson has always said the UK will not put up a border, so with this plan he’s clearly trying to force Ireland to do it instead, in order to protect the integrity of the single market.

It’s as if Farage himself were typing these comments.
The truth is while Brexit will be painful for us, it will prove disastrous for the UK.
Let’s look at it logically and by sector. Agriculture/Food: The vast majority of British Farmers have depended on EU subsidies to survive. They are now gone and the UK government version ends in 2022. This will see most either go to the wall or struggle badly. Added to this the UK currently can only produce 58% of its own basic food requirements. With farms going bust when the subsidies stop that percentage will drop dramatically. Which in turn will mean even more basic foods have to be imported at higher prices due to tariffs. It will also have a knock on effect on the UK food processing industries. Higher costs means less competitive, which in turn means cuts will be made and that usually means lay off’s.
Manufacturing: One of the UK’s most important manufacturing sector is the Auto sector. With 12% Tariffs on every car exported to the EU, it will become unsustainable for any of the large manufacturers to compete with their continental rivals. So the likes of Nissan Land Rover etc will relocate into the EU. But the UK jobs won’t follow because the UK have abandoned freedom of movement. And the loss of these companies will have a knock on effect on all their suppliers.
Shipping: With that UK’s need to import more and more, congestion at UK ports becomes a problem, this is not just a trucking problem, but one for shipping too. With the extra Customs documentation, Ferries and and container ships will be required to spend longer in port before being unloaded, which in turn will cause delays for arriving ships to hearth, and the delays land side mean trucks are delayed being loaded. Time is money and time wasted is going to cost that much more.
Services Sector: As we have seen over the past few years the exodus of Financial Institutions from the UK has been a steady flow, with s no deal Brexit that will become a flood. And again those Jobs won’t travel. The UK travel sector will also suffer. How many Brits will seek holiday and pay for visas for their annual trip to Spanish beaches? No more visa free travel is a double edged sword they never thought about.
And the list goes on. The UK will be feeling the negitive effects of Brexit for the next 20 years at a minimum.","Dec 7th 2020, 12:07 PM"

“Fianna Fáil, which introduced a repressive political regime in harness with the Catholic Church during the Republic’s early years, is notoriously close to big business. It held office during the “Celtic Tiger” years when a property bubble led to the 2007 economic crash, resulting in mass emigration, housing evictions and suicides. Bertie Ahern, the former Fianna Fáil prime minister, remarked in a public speech in 2007 that he didn’t understand why people “cribbing and moaning” about the economy didn’t just “commit suicide”. A 2012 study found that the male suicide rate was 57 per cent higher (476) than its pre-recession level.”

Ireland should be hitting the EU hard for compensatory concessions until such time that

These include rapid changes in the dynamics of global politics, world leadership and terror attacks across Europe.
Douglas Murray travels across Europe to examine first-hand how mass immigration, cultivated self-distrust and delusion have contributed to a continent in the grips of its own demise. From the shores of Lampedusa to migrant camps in Greece, from Cologne to London, he looks critically at the factors that have come together to make Europeans unable to argue for themselves and incapable of resisting their alteration as a society. Murray’s “tremendous and shattering” book addresses the disappointing failures of multiculturalism, Angela Merkel’s U-turn on migration, the lack of repatriation and the Western fixation on guilt, uncovering the malaise at the very heart of the European culture. His conclusion is bleak, but the predictions not irrevocable. As Murray argues, this may be our last chance to change the outcome, before it’s too late.","May 19th 2020, 9:54 AM"

Tried to sell so many lies to viewers that it was all the EUs fault a deal was not being done… The fact is a no deal will hit the UK harder because at the end of the day it is essentially a trading block. ,, hence why the UK wanted to join 3 times in the 1960′s only for Charles De Gaul repeatedly say ‘No’ until he retired they were let in.
The UK people would want to ask themselves why did they join in 1973 ? Simple answer they were losing out…to a trading block.
If they think it is more economicallyl benefical for the average Britton to export and import goods not being part of the EU then off with them, it’s the average guy loses out at the end of the day , paying more in import taxes etc

Why? then you read the report and it says every facet of NI would need to be overhauled with no gain for Ireland, even their education is below standard apparently. The fact is NI has a lot to give Ireland, a lot. Ireland pays for its navy to be servived abroad, start getting it done in NI, NI has goverment ready buildings, to allow the gov to move out of Dublin buildings, sell them, and not miss a beat. NI has fishing zone to add to irelands. If we tackle the big fee, thats security. Ireland could not allow marching season to be a 3 billion security bill every year, this would need an adjustment in attitude from both sides. Nationalists would need to allow marches during march season, and unionists would need to not have such big bonfires on bonfire night. Dublin cant build fast enough, having a city like Belfast enter the scene with cheap property would create a boom in Belfast. Their education system is fine, ireland would get another top grade uni, Queens. Theres is no reason some of the companys who want to set up in Dublin cant set up in Belfast. Increased interest from America from Irish americans who are from scot/north areas. Much better tourisim for both the north and south as the advert for a united Ireland would be amazing, it would also be nice for tourists to visit a place that found “Peace and unity” and not have to talk about politics going from the cliff of moher to the giants causeway to the ring of kerry. I think some people just have a vested interested in a small Ireland, universities dont want another competitor, Trinty still swears an oath to the queen, people dont want their job maybe moving to belfast etc. Lets put it this way, England may never send a company to Belfast ever again, Dublin would and that difference in attitude would likely reduce costs and we can stop bad mouthing the proud people of NI like they are nothing but a drain.","Jan 9th 2021, 4:03 PM"

https://www.thejournal.ie/dup-brexit-conference-arlene-election-boris-brexit-4868866-Oct2019/,"@Stephen McCann: you are spot on there. Most people seriously looking at this inside and outside the establishment are well aware of the findings of that report and know it to be reasonably accurate. There is still some though, particularly within FF/FG who are not comfortable leading this, yet are more afraid of leaving others like SF to get any credit for it when it takes off. They are also afraid of making the first moves themselves for fear of upsetting unionism – and are often to be heard making silly pointless statements like “we are not trying to force unionists into a united Ireland” as we recently heard them say in relation to the Brexit negotiations. whereas, what they should be saying to unionists is – “we have a duty to all the people on the island, but particularly those in the north to encourage a discussion around what kind of new Ireland we would all like to see result from a future democratic border poll”. Such a border poll would not be forcing anyone into a united Ireland, as the outcome would not be predetermined and unionists would be part of that decision process/outcome.
On the contrary – the longer Irish politicians in the south keeps putting off that democratic poll – they are in effect predetermining that a united Ireland can’t happen. 100 years after partition was put in place, southern politicians need to understand that Unionism by its very nature wont/cant change by its own volition, that’s why they are unionists. Therefore, there is no good or bad time to sell a border poll to unionists. They will not welcome it, but as soon as they know its going to happen, will be fast to engage and defend what they see as their interests and fight to get the best possible outcome from whatever results. I feel the run-in debate and discussion period before the actual poll date, could well be very interesting and a great learning experience for all of us. All we need now is some politicians in Dublin/cabinet to grow some balls and begin the discussion. we already know that some former unionist leaders in the north have indicated they would be up for the right kind of discussion/debate that would have to take place in advance of such a border poll.

There are also Provence borders … but of course you are referring to the border between the part of Ireland under the jurisdiction of the Republic and the part under the juristiction of the UK.
Believe it or not some people actually need a passport and a visa to cross that border as people with in the UK including Northern Ireland cannot cross that border without an Irish Visa if an Irish visa is required. Likewise people in the Republic cannot cross the border into Northern Ireland without a UK visa if a UK visa is needed. And people with an Irish and UK holiday visa must have a multi entrance visa to cross the border. The one exception is I believe for Chinese nationals who can obtain a common visa for both the UK and Ireland. There are a few other exceptions – but yes there is a political and immigration border on the island of Ireland.

Our food has become too standardarised. 100 years, in this country, we grew 100 plus varieties of apples, now we grow a standard variety of two or three. Same goes for other fruits.
When was the last time you bit into a pear and had the juice flow down your chin. Such pears can’t be bought anymore. We can now only buy the hard dry variety.
Same goes for chickens and eggs. All standard brown chicken now.

Another, is the big European festivals, like Munich beer festival or my favourite, The Celtic festival in Brittany. People from all over Europe having a great time.
Language is not a problem for most Europeans as they are generally bi or multi-lingual and have been for centuries.

UK breaching Northern Ireland Protocol would be a ‘really big mistake’, Coveney says
The British government is poised to reintroduce elements of its controversial Internal Market Bill next week,
12 hours ago 15,585 35
THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS Minister Simon Coveney has warned the UK it will be making “a really big mistake” if it breaches the Northern Ireland Protocol on Brexit.
The British government is poised to reintroduce elements of its controversial Internal Market Bill next week, which could override the protocol, in a move that would breach international law.
It is also set to table its finance bill, elements of which could also breach parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol – designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland – agreed last year.
It comes amid an intense period of negotiations between the EU and the UK to reach a post-Brexit trade deal.
Coveney said today that such a move by the UK would be taken as a “clear signal” by the EU that the UK does not want a deal.
ADVERTISEMENT
He said: “I think if they do that, it will be a clear signal to the EU that this process is not going to conclude well.
It will be a signal that they effectively don’t want a deal. I really hope that doesn’t happen.
“We have certainly given signals in as respectful, but in as blunt a way as we can, that that would be a really big mistake at this stage in negotiations.
“I think Michel Barnier’s briefing of the meeting this morning would reflect that too.”
Earlier today, the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly briefed European ambassadors that a breach of the Northern Ireland Protocol would trigger a “crisis” and cause a breakdown in trust.
Coveney told the Oireachtas Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union today that an agreement on the implementation of the protocol is close.
He expressed his hope that a deal will be reached soon, which could negate the need for the UK to introduce its own domestic legislation which could override the protocol.
He said: “There’s a lot of negotiating to happen between now and then. I hope there will be no need for domestic legislation that threatens the implementation of the protocol, because of a successful outcome to negotiation. Time will tell.”

Coveney was heavily critical of the British government’s actions around the Internal Market Bill, which he said had damaged their reputation internationally.
He said: “We’ve wasted so much time talking about the Internal Market Bill. The motivation of the British Government in terms of why they’re doing it.
Is it a negotiating strategy? Is it a way of potentially sinking these negotiations if they wanted to?
Coveney added: “It’s undoubtedly doing damage to Britain’s reputation internationally. Not just in the European Union, on the other side of the Atlantic as well.
“They’re just trying to understand, what is the British Government at here?
“It’s in some ways a very provocative approach that has undermined trust and sucked in a huge amount of oxygen that could have been used to resolve these issues through negotiation.
We could have a second piece of legislation that doubles down on the issue through the Finance Bill next week, in the context of another element of the protocol.
“I think the EU will draw only one conclusion if that course of action happens, which will be hugely regrettable.”

@Nigel Barlow: Accusing the USA of being corrupt just 2 days after the British refused a public inquiry into the state sponsored murder of Pat Finucane! And don’t worry about us. 27 other EU countries have our back. Which is just as well seeing as the Brits are at it again! You should be more worried about your own future considering how bleak it looks for the “united” kingdom right now.

@Nigel Barlow: typical brexiters nonsense.
EU is sourcing vaccine for all members, Ireland is part of that.
You talk about Ireland not sourcing flour, the UK has far bigger issues then that. Ireland produces more food then it needs. The UK on the other hand imports most of the food it needs.
If prices increase the avg person in UK is in trouble, the poor in the UK are in even bigger trouble as the state gives less benefits when compared to poor in Ireland.
UK will be down tens of thousands of jobs in motor and finance if they no deal.
If the UK do what this article reports they will have broken international law. That means the UK word is worthless and the gov can’t be trusted. Not to mention they could restart the troubles.

@Nigel Barlow: the EU is behind us and support of the EU by EU members is higher now then anytime in recent years.
The sad brexiters wish of the EU breaking up won’t be happening, the EU has our back. UK on the other hand may loose Scotland in next few years, so the UK may not exist shortly…. What a price to pay for brexit eh?
As for Borders, UK wanted to control its border. Then you can, France can leave everyone across and the UK can sort them out in your ports and airports.
From what I see the UK has trouble stopping a few rafts crossing to its coast without France helping it.

@On the right side: I dont wish any bad on British people but feel sorry for the oncoming impacts of Brexit, especially on the poor who are going to be most affected and further marganalized in society, all because of a campaign of lies, deceipt, misinformation and stoking up people’s emotions based on said facts. Now we see these very same charlatans-the worst in British government since the Thatcher era go back on an international treaty hey signed and voted for less than a year ago which risks peace on Ireland for negotiating ‘leverage’ against the EU. The consequence for the UK is their word is next to useless now and reputation internationally ruined, your in the Russia, Iran club now. It shows how thick the people in charge are now.
Poland and Hungary are vetoing this as their far right and semi autocracies policies are incompatible with EU law and the spirit of the EU.
These two countries are highly dependent on EU funds and membership, they dont genuinely have the power to prevent this budget from passing, it’s like a poor man being told his dole will be stopped if he doesnt stop loitering in his neighborhood, eventually he will see sense to feed himself.
The EU can very easily put Poland and Hungary in their place and soon will. THe commission has a lot of tools at its disposal. Two insignificant non net contributors would be kicked out of the EU before they could be allowed to inflict so much damage to 25 member states","Dec 3rd 2020, 10:54 AM"

It was a war and there were atrocities commited on both sides, but to suggest that it was a one sided battle is a joke. The loyalists and the British goverment were not inocent bystanders. While we can all agree that any loss of life is one life too many you have to put things into context. For us here in the Rebublic to suggest that the nationalist community didnt have a right to fight for their rights is hyprocritical. We didnt get the british to leave by asking them nicely, we killed and bombed them. While FF and FG may want to paint themselves as inocent they have just as much blood on their hands. FF obviously didn’t have any problems supporting the arms struggle in the north during the Arms Crisis (Charles Haughey) but yet they have been able to govern witout any conflicts of intrests. Our country was founded at the barrel of a gun killing a forigen enemy who were supressing our rights and our culture. The men who fought that war held the highest positions in our society. How many deaths was Éamon de Valera responsable for? How many men did he order to have killed? How many of his fellow Irish people did he have killed during the the Civil war? Yet he is seen as the father of our country, we dont talk about the blood on his hands. I think people need to give SF a chance, nobody knows what will happen uintil we do. What we can do is predict with FF and FG will do, as many times before they will screw over the working class in this country to save bankers, developers, insurance companies and basically anyone who has money. While SF may push for a united Ireland, i dont think you are going to see them sending in the defence forces to take over NI, i dont think we would have the resources anyway.

The teacher asked Mr. Varadkar if he would like to lead the discussion on the word ‘Tragedy’.
So Mr. Varadkar asked the class if they could think of an example of a tragedy?
A little boy stood up and said, ‘If a man walks out in front of a bus and is killed stone dead, then that is a tragedy.”
‘Incorrect,’ said Leo ‘That would merely be an accident.’
A little girl stood up and said ‘If a school bus carrying thirty children drove over a cliff, killing everybody inside, that would be a tragedy.’
‘I’m afraid not’, said Leo, ‘That’s what we would call a great loss’.
The room went silent. No other kid volunteered. Leo searched the room.
‘Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?’
Finally, little Johnny raised his hand from the back of the class and said, ‘If a plane carrying you and all the Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour T.D.s was hit by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.’
‘Fantastic!’ exclaimed Leo. ‘And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?’

It will just cost them more.
The UK is only 58% self sufficient in food production. 38% of the remaining food requirements currently come from the EU. The majority of components and raw materials it’s industrial base require, come from the EU. And the finished products are exported to the EU.
With higher prices for practically everything in the UK, the demand for higher wages will follow, which in turn will push up prices even more as companies struggle to maintain profit margins.
Some of those who can, may relocate back into the EU, leaving workers stranded in the UK, as UK workers will have no automatic right to employment within the EU.
Inflation will begin to spiral because of higher prices and following wage demands, unemployment will grow as companies find they cant compete with their EU rivals and go bust, down size or relocate.
The UK are looking at a minimum of two decades of austerity before they can recover from a No Deal Brexit.
Brexiteers will try argue the the UK is the 5th largest economy. But again ignore the fact that it was because of EU membership not in spite of it. And now they are out, they will find the international markets to be a cold and hostile place.","Dec 11th 2020, 1:38 PM"

It looks as if Johnson only signed up to the Withdrawal Agreement to push Brexit over the line in the Commons. The plan all along was to then break it.

This bill still has to pass the house of lords and will be watered down next week in parliament. With a 80 seat majority Boris’s government can get any bill past first stage thanks to labour voters voting for the Tories.","Sep 15th 2020, 11:10 AM"

;How you will pay VAT and customs charges’
There are two ways VAT and customs charges are applied to eligible purchases from the UK:
The business can register with Revenue and collect Irish VAT and any duties payable when you are making your purchase online. You should not have to pay any UK VAT on your purchase. You will not have to pay further Revenue charges on delivery.
If the business is not registered with Revenue, then your package may be subject to VAT and other charges on arrival into Ireland from the UK. The postal service or courier company delivering the package will complete the relevant customs declarations, including where the product is manufactured. You will get a bill from the courier or postal company before your package is delivered. The company usually have an administration charge. Charges vary and there may be a minimum charge (between €10 to €15).","Jan 17th 2021, 11:47 AM"

But work their woe, and thy renown.

All thine shall be the subject main,
And every shore it circles thine.

Shall to thy happy coast repair
Shall to thy happy coast repair;

The bigger team doesn’t have Fish, the City or a land bridge to Ireland. It doesn’t have 42% exports to the UK as Ireland do. It does send £300 billion of EU exports to the UK and are losing £18 billion a year in contributions. The UK only export £180 billion of products to the EU, a massive £120 billion a year deficit. They can buy beef, fruit and veg, wine, machinery, cars, telecoms etc from anywhere in the world. So this could reduce dramatically without a deal.
Leo the paper tiger is trying to big himself up for the Irish electorate and looking foolish. He should protect Ireland from the EU and UK, not take sides. Ireland is too close to the UK to pee them off and they walk away, no deal.","Jan 27th 2020, 10:08 AM"

Then the common currency, which was successfully resisted by Britain, then the referendum in Ireland to commit to fully joining the EU which was defeated, then a second referendum which reversed the decision (manipulated result ?) but never a tie-breaker. Britain was worried by the migrants from different non-assimilating cultures which were overwhelming social services both there and throughout the EU, open borders as well as the accompanying violence and also the gradual erosion of sovereignty. It appears that the EU is a mirror image of the social problems in California which is also run by left wing globalists. A united Germany now runs Europe without ever firing a shot but they primed a ‘cultural time bomb’ when they opened the borders and encouraged illegal migration.

The sovereign state is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the government is often referred to as the British Government just as the army is referred to as the British Army.
People born in the UK or of UK parents are entitled to be considered British and, in the case of Boris Johnson, I am sure he holds a British password.
There is no current sovereign state called England, or Wales or Scotland or Northern Ireland, they are all part of the UK (inc. NI) and the term British is the correct one internationally just as “Irish” people include internal subdivisions from Cork to Donegal, “British” people include those citizens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the British Overseas Territories, and the Crown dependencies.
So internationally there is no real thing called England at this time (except for sports when it suits them soccer and rugby but not olympics – it is great to be able to pick and choose)… and Boris is British and head on the British government and holds a British passpor.

This ruleset is only applicable if you want to be a full member of the European Single Market and it essentially eliminates tariffs on *all* goods and services because you have have agreed to operate within that common framework and incorporates what we now consider to be the standard EU philosophy as regards the free movement of people as well as commercial goods.
The alternative would be a standard trade agreement whereby each side waives tariffs on certain goods you want to export in exchange for reciprocity on other goods they want to export.
In essence, if the UK actually want to remain in the ESM, they have to match the terms already agreed by the 31 member participants. That’s the “level playing field” in a nutshell.","Dec 11th 2020, 10:43 PM"

It’s all about the level playing field. It’s about the EU not accepting a country on its doorstep that undercuts competition by giving state aid.
So this is what’ll happen: the EU will make concessions about the fish, which makes up a tiny percentage of the economy, and the UK will make concessions about the level playing field, which is about major parts of both economies.
And the result is that Boris Johnson will be able to say something like this: “We’ve taken back control of our waters, and of our borders, and we’ve ended free movement.” So he’ll be able to sell the resulting wafer-thin deal to his base.
But in reality the UK will be significantly subject to EU free market rules, and the deal Boris will be able to sell by aforementioned optics won’t be a free-trade deal by a long shot, since there’s no free movement, so there’ll be tariffs.

He doesn’t do too badly, but certainly does f*** up badly during the Iraq war with his christianism-inspired support for George W Bush.
Two decades later the membership finally gets its chance to set the record straight, and votes in the far-left Jeremy Corbyn.
But it seems as though the pendulum swung so far left that sufficient numbers of Remain-supporting voters ended up holding their noses and voted Tory – just to stop a socialist from getting into Number 10.
There’s nothing wrong with Labour as such, or with social democracy if properly implemented, but Corbyn is not a social democrat but a socialist. That’s pushing it too far for the average UK voter.
To be fair, the result of this may well end up not being all that bad for Ireland. Johnson is an opportunist, and he was always only interested in being PM – remember he only pledged allegiance to the Leave campaign at the very last moment.

The DAIL ( TDS ) accountable to us who pay the bills.
But the DAIL who we elected in eleven to send the deal back to f fr never had the govt do that.
Instead the TD passed all the legislation kenny required to satisfy the lender conditon for loan draw down PRIOR to having him lay a bill befored Dail requesting it approval of the terms and TD doing the work they were elected to do in the place they were elected to do it in DAIL EIREANN .
As a result of TD voting and passing legislation Kenny required to get hand on money PRIOR to assert DAIL ROLE in the binding of the people and PRIOR to having bill laid beofre it i am lable for LPT Tax Water Chares and penson age increased and no change to the terms but rather legislation they TD VOTED ON giving min power to take MORE MONEY out of the fund for banks ?
I do not recall C Byrne , M OCallaghan , P Kenny none of them reminding them that they were seeking election to the DAIL and none of them reminded those peole selling them promises of the legislation they voted on giving MINISTER power to take money out of that fund for banks . The fnd they wil need to supplu housing .
They, those TD were not asked to account to us for that legislaiton giving min those powers to impose MORE AUSTERITY on us and not send the deal back to f furt.
None of them asked them TD can they guarantee that a min will not make another promissory note for bank? How can them TD make any promsie on behalf of DAIL EIREANN until DAIL take control of fund and laon and terms . ?
That they are seeking election to DAIL not MERRION STREET.
Not one moderator aks the candidate that question ?
No moderator asked them TD how much is owed by US they decided to C Bank under that promissory note.
In short media failed to hold and tie them td to the frame .. for none of that legislaton and poss austerity wld exist but for their otes .. they want election to DAIL and now anot cost to us of elections.
Media in dwelling all the time on GOT not TD are as much resp as TD ad it aint just me they ned to be told liabe suffering unde the austerity them TD voted on but eery man woman and child in this county for failing to hold them td to account to the peole on their decison as TD after eleven elections and continuing .
Only last year 19 another act passed by TD prescribing transfer of 500 million per anum for five year form that FUND to a rainy day fund and them TD our TD gave min power to use that money for banks or correct overspend and nO WORK in dail on terms .. e g that INBS be merged with Anglo Irish in whose favour P Note made .","Feb 15th 2020, 5:00 AM"
