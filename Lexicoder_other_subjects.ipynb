       "THIS WIN HAS been a long time coming for Mickey Harte.\n",
       "The Tyrone boss enjoyed his second ever victory against Jim Gavin, with his latest one arriving six years to the day after the first.\n",
       "On their first outing at Jones’ Road since the All-Ireland final defeat, Tyrone put away an off-colour Dublin by three points in a confident display.\n",
       "They consigned the Dubs to their third league defeat of the campaign – the most league losses they’ve ever suffered in Gavin’s tenure.\n",
       "It means the reigning league and All-Ireland champions are out of the race to reach the Division 1 final – the first year since he’s taken charge that they’ve failed to make the decider.\n",
       "Kerry, Mayo, Galway and Tyrone are left in the running to meet in the final.\n",
       "This was a performance that Tyrone will file away for later in the summer. They played out the final 20 minutes with a man less after Niall Sludden’s red card, making the win even more impressive.\n",
       "Their two-man full-forward line of Mattie Donnelly and man-of-the-match Cathal McShane were in electric form, contributing 1-7 between them.\n",
       "Crucially, Tyrone delivered early ball into their inside duo and it reaped dividends.\n",
       "Brian Fenton is tackled by Brian Kennedy.Oisin Keniry / INPHOOisin Keniry / INPHO / INPHO\n",
       "Richie Donnelly was excellent at midfield too, and his strong form means Tyrone can afford to leave his brother Mattie further forward.\n",
       "Dublin’s most dangerous attacker in the opening half was Cormac Costello and rattled in his second goal of the campaign just four minutes into the game.\n",
       "Worryingly for Dublin, the in-form Whitehall Colmcilles forward limped off shortly before the break with a knee injury. Dublin had already lost John Small by that stage, while Tyrone’s Tiernan McCann only last until 12 minutes when a hamstring problem forced him off.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "Tyrone’s energy and appetite for work troubled Dublin in the first period. They blew two early goal chances before McShane eventually capitalised on a quality ball inside by Mattie Donnelly.\n",
       "It was a move that displayed McShane’s brain and brawn. He initially outmuscled David Byrne and his low finish past Stephen Cluxton was a picture of calmness.\n",
       "Tyrone led by 1-7 to 1-5 at the interval and the sides went tit-for-tat in the third quarter.\n",
       "The Red Hand’s inside pair of Donnelly and McShane continued to do damage with nearly ever delivery that went into them.\n",
       "Tyrone’s use of the advanced mark was excellent as Peter Harte and McShane both scored from the experimental rule. Kilkenny slotted over Dublin’s third point from play of the half in the 62nd minute on a night where their attack failed to hit its usual heights.\n",
       "A late Mannion free was all they could muster in the form of a comeback as Tyrone defended in numbers and sealed the victory.\n",

       "Traditional Valentine’s Day luxuries such as chocolate and wine received a boost and it was Dunnes Stores which remained Ireland’s top retailer, while Aldi recorded double digit sales growth.\n",
       "The latest figures show the Irish grocery market grew by 3.5% in the 12 weeks to 24 February 2019, putting the sector on a solid footing as the UK finalises preparations to leave the EU.\n",
       "After a period of deflation, an upward trajectory in grocery prices is making a significant contribution to growth, according to industry specialists Kantar.Douglas Faughnan, consumer insight director at Kantar Worldpanel, said that grocery prices rose by a further 1.5% in the most recent 12 weeks, marking the first time an increase has been recorded for four consecutive periods since February 2017.\n",
       "But it was convenience store Valentine’s gifts which saw many shops enjoy a February boost.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "He said: “While many shoppers may have treated their other halves to an evening on the town for Valentine’s Day, supermarkets cashed in from those choosing to celebrate at home.\n",
       "“Convenience continues to be a major priority for people celebrating with a night in.  Valentine’s Day is no different, helping drive overall sales of chilled ready meals and chilled desserts, which grew by 8.4% and 6.9% in the past three months.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The market has also benefited from a weaker pound.\n",
       "Faughnan added: ” A stronger euro to sterling exchange rate has made British imported goods and ingredients cheaper, allowing retailers to pass some of those savings on to Irish consumers.  However, with prices already rising as Britain’s exit from the EU draws near, increases are likely to continue for the rest of the year.\n",
       "“More than €3.5 billion of food is imported to Ireland from the UK, which means currency fluctuation can have a substantial impact on grocery prices.”\n",

retailer, while aldi recorded double digit sales growth. the latest figures show the irish grocery market grew by 3.5% in the 12 weeks to 24 february 2019, putting the sector on a solid footing as the uk finalises preparations to leave the eu. after a period of deflation, an upward trajectory in grocery prices is making a significant contribution to growth, according to industry specialists kantar.douglas faughnan, consumer insight director at kantar worldpanel, said that grocery prices rose by a further 1.5% in the most recent 12 weeks, marking the first time an increase has been recorded for four consecutive periods since february 2017. but it was convenience store valentine’s gifts which saw many shops enjoy a february boost. advertisement he said: “while many shoppers may have treated their other halves to an evening on the town for valentine’s day, supermarkets cashed in from those choosing to celebrate at home. “convenience continues to be a major priority for people celebrating with a night in. valentine’s day is no different, helping drive overall sales of chilled ready meals and chilled desserts, which grew by 8.4% and 6.9% in the past three months.” the market has also benefited from a weaker pound. faughnan added: ” a stronger euro to sterling exchange rate has made british imported goods and ingredients cheaper, allowing retailers to pass some of those savings on to irish consumers. however, with prices already rising as britain’s exit from the eu draws near, increases are likely to continue for the rest of the year. “more than €3.5 billion of food is imported to ireland from the uk, which means currency fluctuation can have a substantial impact on grocery prices.” readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of

       "AWARD-WINNING DUBLIN BURGER restaurant BuJo has asked Dublin City Council to overturn a 16-year-old planning rule so it can keep selling food to-go at its Sandymount Green outlet.\n",
       "The firm has applied for retention permission from city planners to give it clearance for “the consumption of food off the subject premises”, which it said would contribute to the “viability of the business”.\n",
       "A restriction first imposed in 2003 in an original application for a duplex apartment over a ground-floor restaurant forbid the operation of a takeaway at the Dublin 4 site.\n",
       "At the time, An Bord Pleanála stated that the original development could go ahead on the condition that “the restaurant shall not provide a ‘take-out’ service … in the interest of residential amenity”.\n",
       "BuJo opened in the space in 2017. In a submission to the council, prepared on its behalf by property advisor RW Nowlan \\& Associates, the company noted that the “principle uses of a restaurant have changed somewhat” since the early noughties.\n",
       "It stated that a “vast number of restaurants in the Dublin region” operate some kind of “off-premises food consumption”.\n",
       "“The subject restaurant is no exception to this, with the adjoining restaurant operators also trading outside the parameters of the traditional restaurant uses,” it said.\n",
       "Unlike a traditional takeaway shop, BuJo’s submission stated that its food-to-go offering will “blend in with the existing restaurant use” and wouldn’t change how the restaurant looks or currently operates.\n",

       "BuJo suggested that its ability to sell takeaway food has a direct impact on its bottom line:\n",

       "The crux of Bujo’s argument finds some room for manoeuvre in the restriction imposed in 2003.\n",
       "It stated that the “minor nature” of the takeaway element at the restaurant, the fact that it’s related to the main business and the changes in the wider food industry over the last 16 years mean that “no breach has occurred in the modern sense of restaurant use”.\n",
       "In response to queries fromFora, a spokesperson for the city authority said: “Dublin City Council are investigating this matter. The Planning Enforcement Section does not comment on specific cases that are under investigation unless a decision has been made to serve an enforcement notice.”\n",
       "The spokesperson added that “no such decision has been made on this property to date”.\n",
       "Separately in recent weeks, Mexican burrito bar Boojum Boojum sought permission to retain a takeaway at one of its Dublin locations after the council received a complaint alleging that the service is being operated in contravention of planning rules.\n",

              & 2019-03-09 01:01:00 & NA & award-winning dublin burger restaurant bujo has asked dublin city council to overturn a 16-year-old planning rule so it can keep selling food to-go at its sandymount green outlet. the firm has applied for retention permission from city planners to give it clearance for “the consumption of food off the subject premises”, which it said would contribute to the “viability of the business”. a restriction first imposed in 2003 in an original application for a duplex apartment over a ground-floor restaurant forbid the operation of a takeaway at the dublin 4 site. at the time, an bord pleanála stated that the original development could go ahead on the condition that “the restaurant shall not provide a ‘take-out’ service … in the interest of residential amenity”. bujo opened in the space in 2017. in a submission to the council, prepared on its behalf by property advisor rw nowlan \\& associates, the company noted that the “principle uses of a restaurant have changed somewhat” since the early noughties. it stated that a “vast number of restaurants in the dublin region” operate some kind of “off-premises food consumption”. “the subject restaurant is no exception to this, with the adjoining restaurant operators also trading outside the parameters of the traditional restaurant uses,” it said. unlike a traditional takeaway shop, bujo’s submission stated that its food-to-go offering will “blend in with the existing restaurant use” and wouldn’t change how the restaurant looks or currently operates. advertisement bujo suggested that its ability to sell takeaway food has a direct impact on its bottom line: chris bellew / fennell photographychris bellew / fennell photography / fennell photography the crux of bujo’s argument finds some room for manoeuvre in the restriction imposed in 2003. it stated that the “minor nature” of the takeaway element at the restaurant, the fact that it’s related to the main business and the changes in the wider food industry over the last 16 years mean that “no breach has occurred in the modern sense of restaurant use”. in response to queries fromfora, a spokesperson for the city authority said: “dublin city council are investigating this matter. the planning enforcement section does not comment on specific cases that are under investigation unless a decision has been made to serve an enforcement notice.” the spokesperson added that “no such decision has been made on this property to date”. separately in recent weeks, mexican burrito bar boojum boojum sought permission to retain a takeaway at one of its dublin locations after the council received a complaint alleging that the service is being operated in contravention of planning rules. get our new daily briefing with the

       "Traditional Valentine’s Day luxuries such as chocolate and wine received a boost and it was Dunnes Stores which remained Ireland’s top retailer, while Aldi recorded double digit sales growth.\n",
       "The latest figures show the Irish grocery market grew by 3.5\\% in the 12 weeks to 24 February 2019, putting the sector on a solid footing as the UK finalises preparations to leave the EU.\n",
       "After a period of deflation, an upward trajectory in grocery prices is making a significant contribution to growth, according to industry specialists Kantar.Douglas Faughnan, consumer insight director at Kantar Worldpanel, said that grocery prices rose by a further 1.5\\% in the most recent 12 weeks, marking the first time an increase has been recorded for four consecutive periods since February 2017.\n",
       "But it was convenience store Valentine’s gifts which saw many shops enjoy a February boost.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "He said: “While many shoppers may have treated their other halves to an evening on the town for Valentine’s Day, supermarkets cashed in from those choosing to celebrate at home.\n",
       "“Convenience continues to be a major priority for people celebrating with a night in.  Valentine’s Day is no different, helping drive overall sales of chilled ready meals and chilled desserts, which grew by 8.4\\% and 6.9\\% in the past three months.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The market has also benefited from a weaker pound.\n",
       "Faughnan added: ” A stronger euro to sterling exchange rate has made British imported goods and ingredients cheaper, allowing retailers to pass some of those savings on to Irish consumers.  However, with prices already rising as Britain’s exit from the EU draws near, increases are likely to continue for the rest of the year.\n",
       "“More than €3.5 billion of food is imported to Ireland from the UK, which means currency fluctuation can have a substantial impact on grocery prices.”\n",

which saw the sale of traditional gifts surge. traditional valentine’s day luxuries such as chocolate and wine received a boost and it was dunnes stores which remained ireland’s top retailer, while aldi recorded double digit sales growth. the latest figures show the irish grocery market grew by 3.5\\% in the 12 weeks to 24 february 2019, putting the sector on a solid footing as the uk finalises preparations to leave the eu. after a period of deflation, an upward trajectory in grocery prices is making a significant contribution to growth, according to industry specialists kantar.douglas faughnan, consumer insight director at kantar worldpanel, said that grocery prices rose by a further 1.5\\% in the most recent 12 weeks, marking the first time an increase has been recorded for four consecutive periods since february 2017. but it was convenience store valentine’s gifts which saw many shops enjoy a february boost. advertisement he said: “while many shoppers may have treated their other halves to an evening on the town for valentine’s day, supermarkets cashed in from those choosing to celebrate at home. “convenience continues to be a major priority for people celebrating with a night in. valentine’s day is no different, helping drive overall sales of chilled ready meals and chilled desserts, which grew by 8.4\\% and 6.9\\% in the past three months.” the market has also benefited from a weaker pound. faughnan added: ” a stronger euro to sterling exchange rate has made british imported goods and ingredients cheaper, allowing retailers to pass some of those savings on to irish consumers. however, with prices already rising as britain’s exit from the eu draws near, increases are likely to continue for the rest of the year. “more than €3.5 billion of food is imported to ireland from the uk, which means currency fluctuation can have a substantial impact on grocery prices.” readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and

       "AWARD-WINNING DUBLIN BURGER restaurant BuJo has asked Dublin City Council to overturn a 16-year-old planning rule so it can keep selling food to-go at its Sandymount Green outlet.\n",
       "The firm has applied for retention permission from city planners to give it clearance for “the consumption of food off the subject premises”, which it said would contribute to the “viability of the business”.\n",
       "A restriction first imposed in 2003 in an original application for a duplex apartment over a ground-floor restaurant forbid the operation of a takeaway at the Dublin 4 site.\n",
       "At the time, An Bord Pleanála stated that the original development could go ahead on the condition that “the restaurant shall not provide a ‘take-out’ service … in the interest of residential amenity”.\n",
       "BuJo opened in the space in 2017. In a submission to the council, prepared on its behalf by property advisor RW Nowlan &amp; Associates, the company noted that the “principle uses of a restaurant have changed somewhat” since the early noughties.\n",
       "It stated that a “vast number of restaurants in the Dublin region” operate some kind of “off-premises food consumption”.\n",
       "“The subject restaurant is no exception to this, with the adjoining restaurant operators also trading outside the parameters of the traditional restaurant uses,” it said.\n",
       "Unlike a traditional takeaway shop, BuJo’s submission stated that its food-to-go offering will “blend in with the existing restaurant use” and wouldn’t change how the restaurant looks or currently operates.\n",

       "The crux of Bujo’s argument finds some room for manoeuvre in the restriction imposed in 2003.\n",
       "It stated that the “minor nature” of the takeaway element at the restaurant, the fact that it’s related to the main business and the changes in the wider food industry over the last 16 years mean that “no breach has occurred in the modern sense of restaurant use”.\n",
       "In response to queries fromFora, a spokesperson for the city authority said: “Dublin City Council are investigating this matter. The Planning Enforcement Section does not comment on specific cases that are under investigation unless a decision has been made to serve an enforcement notice.”\n",
       "The spokesperson added that “no such decision has been made on this property to date”.\n",
       "Separately in recent weeks, Mexican burrito bar Boojum Boojum sought permission to retain a takeaway at one of its Dublin locations after the council received a complaint alleging that the service is being operated in contravention of planning rules.\n",

associates, the company noted that the “principle uses of a restaurant have changed somewhat” since the early noughties. it stated that a “vast number of restaurants in the dublin region” operate some kind of “off-premises food consumption”. “the subject restaurant is no exception to this, with the adjoining restaurant operators also trading outside the parameters of the traditional restaurant uses,” it said. unlike a traditional takeaway shop, bujo’s submission stated that its food-to-go offering will “blend in with the existing restaurant use” and wouldn’t change how the restaurant looks or currently operates. advertisement bujo suggested that its ability to sell takeaway food has a direct impact on its bottom line: chris bellew / fennell photographychris bellew / fennell photography / fennell photography the crux of bujo’s argument finds some room for manoeuvre in the restriction imposed in 2003. it stated that the “minor nature” of the takeaway element at the restaurant, the fact that it’s related to the main business and the changes in the wider food industry over the last 16 years mean that “no breach has occurred in the modern sense of restaurant use”. in response to queries fromfora, a spokesperson for the city authority said: “dublin city council are investigating this matter. the planning enforcement section does not comment on specific cases that are under investigation unless a decision has been made to serve an enforcement notice.” the spokesperson added that “no such decision has been made on this property to date”. separately in recent weeks, mexican burrito bar boojum boojum sought permission to retain a takeaway at one of its dublin locations after the council received a complaint alleging that the service is being operated in contravention of planning rules. get our new daily briefing with the morning’s most important headlines for innovative irish businesses. written by zuzia whelan and posted onfora.ie readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.over 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.learn moresupport the journal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

       "Traditional Valentine’s Day luxuries such as chocolate and wine received a boost and it was Dunnes Stores which remained Ireland’s top retailer, while Aldi recorded double digit sales growth.\n",
       "The latest figures show the Irish grocery market grew by 3.5% in the 12 weeks to 24 February 2019, putting the sector on a solid footing as the UK finalises preparations to leave the EU.\n",
       "After a period of deflation, an upward trajectory in grocery prices is making a significant contribution to growth, according to industry specialists Kantar.Douglas Faughnan, consumer insight director at Kantar Worldpanel, said that grocery prices rose by a further 1.5% in the most recent 12 weeks, marking the first time an increase has been recorded for four consecutive periods since February 2017.\n",
       "But it was convenience store Valentine’s gifts which saw many shops enjoy a February boost.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "He said: “While many shoppers may have treated their other halves to an evening on the town for Valentine’s Day, supermarkets cashed in from those choosing to celebrate at home.\n",
       "“Convenience continues to be a major priority for people celebrating with a night in.  Valentine’s Day is no different, helping drive overall sales of chilled ready meals and chilled desserts, which grew by 8.4% and 6.9% in the past three months.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The market has also benefited from a weaker pound.\n",
       "Faughnan added: ” A stronger euro to sterling exchange rate has made British imported goods and ingredients cheaper, allowing retailers to pass some of those savings on to Irish consumers.  However, with prices already rising as Britain’s exit from the EU draws near, increases are likely to continue for the rest of the year.\n",
       "“More than €3.5 billion of food is imported to Ireland from the UK, which means currency fluctuation can have a substantial impact on grocery prices.”\n",

saw the sale of traditional gifts surge. traditional valentine’s day luxuries such as chocolate and wine received a boost and it was dunnes stores which remained ireland’s top retailer, while aldi recorded double digit sales growth. the latest figures show the irish grocery market grew by 3.5% in the 12 weeks to 24 february 2019, putting the sector on a solid footing as the uk finalises preparations to leave the eu. after a period of deflation, an upward trajectory in grocery prices is making a significant contribution to growth, according to industry specialists kantar.douglas faughnan, consumer insight director at kantar worldpanel, said that grocery prices rose by a further 1.5% in the most recent 12 weeks, marking the first time an increase has been recorded for four consecutive periods since february 2017. but it was convenience store valentine’s gifts which saw many shops enjoy a february boost. advertisement he said: “while many shoppers may have treated their other halves to an evening on the town for valentine’s day, supermarkets cashed in from those choosing to celebrate at home. “convenience continues to be a major priority for people celebrating with a night in. valentine’s day is no different, helping drive overall sales of chilled ready meals and chilled desserts, which grew by 8.4% and 6.9% in the past three months.” the market has also benefited from a weaker pound. faughnan added: ” a stronger euro to sterling exchange rate has made british imported goods and ingredients cheaper, allowing retailers to pass some of those savings on to irish consumers. however, with prices already rising as britain’s exit from the eu draws near, increases are likely to continue for the rest of the year. “more than €3.5 billion of food is imported to ireland from the uk, which means currency fluctuation can have a substantial impact on grocery prices.” readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and

       "1 \\nAWARD-WINNING DUBLIN BURGER restaurant BuJo has asked Dublin City Council to overturn a 16-year-old planning rule so it can keep selling food to-go at its Sandymount Green outlet.\\nThe firm has applied for retention permission from city planners to give it clearance for “the consumption of food off the subject premises”, which it said would contribute to the “viability of the business”.\\nA restriction first imposed in 2003 in an original application for a duplex apartment over a ground-floor restaurant forbid the operation of a takeaway at the Dublin 4 site.\\nAt the time, An Bord Pleanála stated that the original development could go ahead on the condition that “the restaurant shall not provide a ‘take-out’ service … in the interest of residential amenity”.\\nBuJo opened in the space in 2017. In a submission to the council, prepared on its behalf by property advisor RW Nowlan & Associates, the company noted that the “principle uses of a restaurant have changed somewhat” since the early noughties.\\nIt stated that a “vast number of restaurants in the Dublin region” operate some kind of “off-premises food consumption”.\\n“The subject restaurant is no exception to this, with the adjoining restaurant operators also trading outside the parameters of the traditional restaurant uses,” it said.\\nUnlike a traditional takeaway shop, BuJo’s submission stated that its food-to-go offering will “blend in with the existing restaurant use” and wouldn’t change how the restaurant looks or currently operates.\\nAdvertisement\\nBuJo suggested that its ability to sell takeaway food has a direct impact on its bottom line:\\nChris Bellew / Fennell PhotographyChris Bellew / Fennell Photography / Fennell Photography\\nThe crux of Bujo’s argument finds some room for manoeuvre in the restriction imposed in 2003.\\nIt stated that the “minor nature” of the takeaway element at the restaurant, the fact that it’s related to the main business and the changes in the wider food industry over the last 16 years mean that “no breach has occurred in the modern sense of restaurant use”.\\nIn response to queries fromFora, a spokesperson for the city authority said: “Dublin City Council are investigating this matter. The Planning Enforcement Section does not comment on specific cases that are under investigation unless a decision has been made to serve an enforcement notice.”\\nThe spokesperson added that “no such decision has been made on this property to date”.\\nSeparately in recent weeks, Mexican burrito bar Boojum Boojum sought permission to retain a takeaway at one of its Dublin locations after the council received a complaint alleging that the service is being operated in contravention of planning rules.\\nGet our NEW Daily Briefing with the morning’s most important headlines for innovative Irish businesses.\\nWritten by Zuzia Whelan and posted onFora.ie\\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...A mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.Over 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.Learn MoreSupport The Journal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "2 Kevin O’Brien reports from Croke Park\\nTHIS WIN HAS been a long time coming for Mickey Harte.\\nThe Tyrone boss enjoyed his second ever victory against Jim Gavin, with his latest one arriving six years to the day after the first.\\nOn their first outing at Jones’ Road since the All-Ireland final defeat, Tyrone put away an off-colour Dublin by three points in a confident display.\\nThey consigned the Dubs to their third league defeat of the campaign – the most league losses they’ve ever suffered in Gavin’s tenure.\\nIt means the reigning league and All-Ireland champions are out of the race to reach the Division 1 final – the first year since he’s taken charge that they’ve failed to make the decider.\\nKerry, Mayo, Galway and Tyrone are left in the running to meet in the final.\\nThis was a performance that Tyrone will file away for later in the summer. They played out the final 20 minutes with a man less after Niall Sludden’s red card, making the win even more impressive.\\nTheir two-man full-forward line of Mattie Donnelly and man-of-the-match Cathal McShane were in electric form, contributing 1-7 between them.\\nCrucially, Tyrone delivered early ball into their inside duo and it reaped dividends.\\nBrian Fenton is tackled by Brian Kennedy.Oisin Keniry / INPHOOisin Keniry / INPHO / INPHO\\nRichie Donnelly was excellent at midfield too, and his strong form means Tyrone can afford to leave his brother Mattie further forward.\\nDublin’s most dangerous attacker in the opening half was Cormac Costello and rattled in his second goal of the campaign just four minutes into the game.\\nWorryingly for Dublin, the in-form Whitehall Colmcilles forward limped off shortly before the break with a knee injury. Dublin had already lost John Small by that stage, while Tyrone’s Tiernan McCann only last until 12 minutes when a hamstring problem forced him off.\\nAdvertisement\\nTyrone’s energy and appetite for work troubled Dublin in the first period. They blew two early goal chances before McShane eventually capitalised on a quality ball inside by Mattie Donnelly.\\nIt was a move that displayed McShane’s brain and brawn. He initially outmuscled David Byrne and his low finish past Stephen Cluxton was a picture of calmness.\\nTyrone led by 1-7 to 1-5 at the interval and the sides went tit-for-tat in the third quarter.\\nThe Red Hand’s inside pair of Donnelly and McShane continued to do damage with nearly ever delivery that went into them.\\nTyrone’s use of the advanced mark was excellent as Peter Harte and McShane both scored from the experimental rule. Kilkenny slotted over Dublin’s third point from play of the half in the 62nd minute on a night where their attack failed to hit its usual heights.\\nA late Mannion free was all they could muster in the form of a comeback as Tyrone defended in numbers and sealed the victory.\\nScorers for Tyrone:Cathal McShane 1-4 (0-2m, 0-1f), Mattie Donnelly and Peter Harte (0-1m, 0-2f) 0-3 each, Richard Donnelly and Niall Morgan (0-2f) 0-2 each.\\nScorers for Dublin:Paul Mannion 0-4 (0-2f, 0-1m), Cormac Costello 1-0, Ciaran Kilkenny and Dean Rock (0-2f) 0-2 each, Brian Fenton and Con O’Callaghan 0-1 each.\\n1. Niall Morgan (Edendork)\\n2.

       "5 GROCERY SALES INCREASED by 3.5% in the latest retail period thanks, in part, to a bumper Valentine’s trade which saw  the sale of traditional gifts surge.\\nTraditional Valentine’s Day luxuries such as chocolate and wine received a boost and it was Dunnes Stores which remained Ireland’s top retailer, while Aldi recorded double digit sales growth.\\nThe latest figures show the Irish grocery market grew by 3.5% in the 12 weeks to 24 February 2019, putting the sector on a solid footing as the UK finalises preparations to leave the EU.\\nAfter a period of deflation, an upward trajectory in grocery prices is making a significant contribution to growth, according to industry specialists Kantar.Douglas Faughnan, consumer insight director at Kantar Worldpanel, said that grocery prices rose by a further 1.5% in the most recent 12 weeks, marking the first time an increase has been recorded for four consecutive periods since February 2017.\\nBut it was convenience store Valentine’s gifts which saw many shops enjoy a February boost.\\nAdvertisement\\nHe said: “While many shoppers may have treated their other halves to an evening on the town for Valentine’s Day, supermarkets cashed in from those choosing to celebrate at home.\\n“Convenience continues to be a major priority for people celebrating with a night in.  Valentine’s Day is no different, helping drive overall sales of chilled ready meals and chilled desserts, which grew by 8.4% and 6.9% in the past three months.”\\n\\nThe market has also benefited from a weaker pound.\\nFaughnan added: ” A stronger euro to sterling exchange rate has made British imported goods and ingredients cheaper, allowing retailers to pass some of those savings on to Irish consumers.  However, with prices already rising as Britain’s exit from the EU draws near, increases are likely to continue for the rest of the year.\\n“More than €3.5 billion of food is imported to Ireland from the UK, which means currency fluctuation can have a substantial impact on grocery prices.”\\n\\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...A mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.Over 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.Learn MoreSupport The Journal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "1 award-winning dublin burger restaurant bujo has asked dublin city council to overturn a 16-year-old planning rule so it can keep selling food to-go at its sandymount green outlet. the firm has applied for retention permission from city planners to give it clearance for “the consumption of food off the subject premises”, which it said would contribute to the “viability of the business”. a restriction first imposed in 2003 in an original application for a duplex apartment over a ground-floor restaurant forbid the operation of a takeaway at the dublin 4 site. at the time, an bord pleanála stated that the original development could go ahead on the condition that “the restaurant shall not provide a ‘take-out’ service … in the interest of residential amenity”. bujo opened in the space in 2017. in a submission to the council, prepared on its behalf by property advisor rw nowlan & associates, the company noted that the “principle uses of a restaurant have changed somewhat” since the early noughties. it stated that a “vast number of restaurants in the dublin region” operate some kind of “off-premises food consumption”. “the subject restaurant is no exception to this, with the adjoining restaurant operators also trading outside the parameters of the traditional restaurant uses,” it said. unlike a traditional takeaway shop, bujo’s submission stated that its food-to-go offering will “blend in with the existing restaurant use” and wouldn’t change how the restaurant looks or currently operates. advertisement bujo suggested that its ability to sell takeaway food has a direct impact on its bottom line: chris bellew / fennell photographychris bellew / fennell photography / fennell photography the crux of bujo’s argument finds some room for manoeuvre in the restriction imposed in 2003. it stated that the “minor nature” of the takeaway element at the restaurant, the fact that it’s related to the main business and the changes in the wider food industry over the last 16 years mean that “no breach has occurred in the modern sense of restaurant use”. in response to queries fromfora, a spokesperson for the city authority said: “dublin city council are investigating this matter. the planning enforcement section does not comment on specific cases that are under investigation unless a decision has been made to serve an enforcement notice.” the spokesperson added that “no such decision has been made on this property to date”. separately in recent weeks, mexican burrito bar boojum boojum sought permission to retain a takeaway at one of its dublin locations after the council received a complaint alleging that the service is being operated in contravention of planning rules. get our new daily briefing with the morning’s most important headlines for innovative irish businesses. written by zuzia whelan and posted onfora.ie readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.over 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.learn moresupport the journal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "2 kevin o’brien reports from croke park this win has been a long time coming for mickey harte. the tyrone boss enjoyed his second ever victory against jim gavin, with his latest one arriving six years to the day after the first. on their first outing at jones’ road since the all-ireland final defeat, tyrone put away an off-colour dublin by three points in a confident display. they consigned the dubs to their third league defeat of the campaign – the most league losses they’ve ever suffered in gavin’s tenure. it means the reigning league and all-ireland champions are out of the race to reach the division 1 final – the first year since he’s taken charge that they’ve failed to make the decider. kerry, mayo, galway and tyrone are left in the running to meet in the final. this was a performance that tyrone will file away for later in the summer. they played out the final 20 minutes with a man less after niall sludden’s red card, making the win even more impressive. their two-man full-forward line of mattie donnelly and man-of-the-match cathal mcshane were in electric form, contributing 1-7 between them. crucially, tyrone delivered early ball into their inside duo and it reaped dividends. brian fenton is tackled by brian kennedy.oisin keniry / inphooisin keniry / inpho / inpho richie donnelly was excellent at midfield too, and his strong form means tyrone can afford to leave his brother mattie further forward. dublin’s most dangerous attacker in the opening half was cormac costello and rattled in his second goal of the campaign just four minutes into the game. worryingly for dublin, the in-form whitehall colmcilles forward limped off shortly before the break with a knee injury. dublin had already lost john small by that stage, while tyrone’s tiernan mccann only last until 12 minutes when a hamstring problem forced him off. advertisement tyrone’s energy and appetite for work troubled dublin in the first period. they blew two early goal chances before mcshane eventually capitalised on a quality ball inside by mattie donnelly. it was a move that displayed mcshane’s brain and brawn. he initially outmuscled david byrne and his low finish past stephen cluxton was a picture of calmness. tyrone led by 1-7 to 1-5 at the interval and the sides went tit-for-tat in the third quarter. the red hand’s inside pair of donnelly and mcshane continued to do damage with nearly ever delivery that went into them. tyrone’s use of the advanced mark was excellent as peter harte and mcshane both scored from the experimental rule. kilkenny slotted over dublin’s third point from play of the half in the 62nd minute on a night where their attack failed to hit its usual heights. a late mannion free was all they could muster in the form of a comeback as tyrone defended in numbers and sealed the victory. scorers for tyrone:cathal mcshane 1-4 (0-2m, 0-1f), mattie donnelly and peter harte (0-1m, 0-2f) 0-3 each, richard donnelly and niall morgan (0-2f) 0-2 each. scorers for dublin:paul mannion 0-4 (0-2f, 0-1m), cormac costello 1-0, ciaran kilkenny and dean rock (0-2f) 0-2 each, brian fenton and con o’callaghan 0-1 each. 1. niall morgan (edendork) 2. pádraig hampsey (coalisland)4. hugh pat mcgeary (pomeroy)3. ronan mcnamee (aghyaran) 5. tiernan mccann (killyclogher) 22. brian kennedy (doire lochain)7. ben mcdonnell (errigal ciaran)15. kieran mcgeary (pomeroy) 12. conor meyler (omagh)9. richie donnelly (trillick) 11. niall sludden (dromore)14. peter harte (errigal ciaran)6. frank burns (pomeroy) 10. mattie donnelly (trillick)8. cathal mcshane (owen roe) subs 18. rory brennan (trillick) for mccann (inj, 12)13. connor mcaliskey (clonloe) for burns (60)20. colm cavanagh (moy) for mcnamee (62)25. darren mccurry (edendork) for kennedy (68) 1. evan comerford (ballymun kickhams) 2. jonny cooper (na fianna)3. david byrne (naomh olaf) 4. cian o’connor (kilmacud crokes) 24. james mccarthy (ballymund kickhams)6. cian o’sullivan (kilmacud crokes)7. john small (ballymun kickhams) 5. brian howard (raheny)8. brian fenton (raheny) 10. con o’callaghan (cuala)12. niall scully (templeogue synge street)14. ciaran kilkenny (castleknock) 13. dean rock (ballymun kickhams)11. cormac costello (whitehall colmcilles)22. paul mannion (kilmacud crokes) subs 19. darren daly (fingal ravens) for small (inj, 30)15. paddy andrews (st brigid’s) for costello (inj, 35)25. kevin mcmanamon (st jude’s) for andrews (blood sub, 48)9. darren gavin (lucan sarsfields) for o’sullivan (57)26. eoghan o’gara (templeogue synge street) for rock (60) referee:jerome henry (mayo) subscribe to our new podcast, the42 rugby weekly, here: subscribe\n",

       "5 grocery sales increased by 3.5% in the latest retail period thanks, in part, to a bumper valentine’s trade which saw the sale of traditional gifts surge. traditional valentine’s day luxuries such as chocolate and wine received a boost and it was dunnes stores which remained ireland’s top retailer, while aldi recorded double digit sales growth. the latest figures show the irish grocery market grew by 3.5% in the 12 weeks to 24 february 2019, putting the sector on a solid footing as the uk finalises preparations to leave the eu. after a period of deflation, an upward trajectory in grocery prices is making a significant contribution to growth, according to industry specialists kantar.douglas faughnan, consumer insight director at kantar worldpanel, said that grocery prices rose by a further 1.5% in the most recent 12 weeks, marking the first time an increase has been recorded for four consecutive periods since february 2017. but it was convenience store valentine’s gifts which saw many shops enjoy a february boost. advertisement he said: “while many shoppers may have treated their other halves to an evening on the town for valentine’s day, supermarkets cashed in from those choosing to celebrate at home. “convenience continues to be a major priority for people celebrating with a night in. valentine’s day is no different, helping drive overall sales of chilled ready meals and chilled desserts, which grew by 8.4% and 6.9% in the past three months.” the market has also benefited from a weaker pound. faughnan added: ” a stronger euro to sterling exchange rate has made british imported goods and ingredients cheaper, allowing retailers to pass some of those savings on to irish consumers. however, with prices already rising as britain’s exit from the eu draws near, increases are likely to continue for the rest of the year. “more than €3.5 billion of food is imported to ireland from the uk, which means currency fluctuation can have a substantial impact on grocery prices.” readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.over 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.learn moresupport the journal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "London, Belfast and Dublin were blindsided by a recent attempt by the European Commission to invoke Article 16, in a row over the supply of vaccines to Europe.\n",
       "The Article overrides part of the Northern Ireland Protocol which prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, and was intended as an emergency measure not to be used.\n",
       "The European Commission backtracked on the decision, but it has caused massive political fallout, particularly in the North.\n",
       "European Affairs Minister Thomas Byrne said the Government is seeking a new safety clause, to prevent a repeat of those events.\n",
       "He told the Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs: “The reaction of Government that day was complete shock and surprise, and with no knowledge of what was being planned.\n",
       "“We had spent the previous few weeks being asked about Article 16 from another perspective, and quite rightly pointing out that this was a pretty standard safeguarding clause in the trade agreement.\n",
       "“And not designed to either eliminate the protocol or not designed to be used, except in the most extreme circumstances.”\n",
       "He said the Government is continuing to engage on multiple levels with the European Commission and the UK Government to find a resolution.\n",
       "Byrne added: “What the Government wants fundamentally is an early warning system to be put in place.\n",
       "“There is a view, and it’s a risky view, that, yes, the Commission made a mistake, yes the Commission acknowledged its mistake, and that is everything solved now.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "“Clearly that’s not the case because the consequences of this are continuing.”\n",
       "Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond questioned if the damage caused by the incident was fully appreciated by the EU.\n",
       "He said: “I think the damage has been lasting. I think what we saw in the days after was that people leapt at the opportunity where a mistake was made.\n",
       "“Are the British government now in danger of pushing this too far? We see extra demands, we see a consistent underlining that they are now preparing to trigger Article 16.\n",
       "“We look at the, albeit typical British newspapers, and they’re demanding a renegotiation less than six weeks after the trade deal was agreed.\n",
       "“I’m very worried that less than six weeks in, people are really damaging the house of cards.”\n",
       "But Byrne said that despite the damage caused, Article 16 will not be removed from the protocol.\n",
       "He said: “Even the Article 16 invocation, or attempted invocation, a couple of weeks ago didn’t eliminate the protocol.\n",
       "“The protocol is still there to avoid a hard border on the island, to make sure people and goods can move freely and that Northern Ireland remains part of the single market of the European Union.”\n",
       "Irish officials are meeting with senior figures in the European Commission on Tuesday to discuss mechanisms to avoid a repeat of the Article 16 affair.\n",
       "Byrne said he would not describe the engagement as a “key crunch meeting”.\n",
       "He added: “There will be ongoing engagements. We may not have resolution on this today, but I think safe to say at the moment, people are fully aware the significance of what has transpired.”\n",

                                </td><td>2021-02-09</td><td>NA</td><td>the government is to seek an “early warning system” on the use of article 16 of the northern ireland protocol on brexit. london, belfast and dublin were blindsided by a recent attempt by the european commission to invoke article 16, in a row over the supply of vaccines to europe. the article overrides part of the northern ireland protocol which prevents a hard border on the island of ireland, and was intended as an emergency measure not to be used. the european commission backtracked on the decision, but it has caused massive political fallout, particularly in the north. european affairs minister thomas byrne said the government is seeking a new safety clause, to prevent a repeat of those events. he told the oireachtas committee on european union affairs: “the reaction of government that day was complete shock and surprise, and with no knowledge of what was being planned. “we had spent the previous few weeks being asked about article 16 from another perspective, and quite rightly pointing out that this was a pretty standard safeguarding clause in the trade agreement. “and not designed to either eliminate the protocol or not designed to be used, except in the most extreme circumstances.” he said the government is continuing to engage on multiple levels with the european commission and the uk government to find a resolution. byrne added: “what the government wants fundamentally is an early warning system to be put in place. “there is a view, and it’s a risky view, that, yes, the commission made a mistake, yes the commission acknowledged its mistake, and that is everything solved now. advertisement “clearly that’s not the case because the consequences of this are continuing.” fine gael td neale richmond questioned if the damage caused by the incident was fully appreciated by the eu. he said: “i think the damage has been lasting. i think what we saw in the days after was that people leapt at the opportunity where a mistake was made. “are the british government now in danger of pushing this too far? we see extra demands, we see a consistent underlining that they are now preparing to trigger article 16. “we look at the, albeit typical british newspapers, and they’re demanding a renegotiation less than six weeks after the trade deal was agreed. “i’m very worried that less than six weeks in, people are really damaging the house of cards.” but byrne said that despite the damage caused, article 16 will not be removed from the protocol. he said: “even the article 16 invocation, or attempted invocation, a couple of weeks ago didn’t eliminate the protocol. “the protocol is still there to avoid a hard border on the island, to make sure people and goods can move freely and that northern ireland remains part of the single market of the european union.” irish officials are meeting with senior figures in the european commission on tuesday to discuss mechanisms to avoid a repeat of the article 16 affair. byrne said he would not describe the engagement as a “key crunch meeting”. he added: “there will be ongoing engagements. we may not have resolution on this today, but i think safe to say at the moment, people are fully aware the significance of what has transpired.” readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting

       "BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Rishi Sunak has travelled to the North ahead of talks with Stormont politicians amid growing speculation that a deal between the UK and EU over the controversial post-Brexit Protocol is imminent.\n",
       "The Tory leader is joined by Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris ahead of talks with political parties in the region over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n",
       "Sunak will hold talks with Stormont parties and other stakeholders tomorrow.\n",
       "He last visited Northern Ireland in December and his latest visit will be seen as a signal that a deal over the trading arrangements for the region could be unveiled within days.\n",
       "A spokeswoman for Sunak said: “Whilst talks with the EU are ongoing, ministers continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure any solution fixes the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.\n",
       "“The Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland are travelling to Northern Ireland this evening to speak to political parties as part of this engagement process.”\n",
       "However, a senior DUP figure has warned that a failure to end the imposition of EU law in Northern Ireland in any new UK/EU deal on post-Brexit trade will ensure Stormont’s power-sharing impasse continues.\n",
       "Nigel Dodds insisted his party would maintain its block on devolution if an agreement falls short of the measures contained within the UK Government’s own stalled draft legislation to unilaterally rip up the contentious Northern Ireland Protocol.\n",
       "The Northern Ireland Protocol Bill includes provisions that would remove the oversight of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the region.\n",
       "While it is understood the EU and UK are close to signing off a deal that would reduce Protocol red tape on the movement of goods from Britain to Northern Ireland, there is no expectation that Brussels is willing to agree to ending the application of EU law in the region.\n",
       "The EU contends a fundamental plank of the Protocol – namely that Northern Ireland traders can sell freely into the European single market – is dependent on the operation of EU rules in region.\n",
       "Speculation is intensifying that a deal could be unveiled imminently, potentially early next week.\n",

       "Following his visit to Northern Ireland, Sunak is set to join European leaders in Germany this weekend for the Munich Security Conference and the protocol is likely to feature in discussions on the margins.\n",
       "Dodds, a former deputy leader of the DUP who now leads the party in the UK’s House of Lords, said the continued application of EU law in Northern Ireland would not be acceptable to his party.\n",
       "His comments, and similar remarks from other senior colleagues, suggest a new deal between the EU and UK may not ultimately be enough to convince the DUP to return to power-sharing at Stormont.\n",
       "The DUP is currently blocking the functioning of the devolved institutions in Belfast in protest at the protocol.\n",

has travelled to the north ahead of talks with stormont politicians amid growing speculation that a deal between the uk and eu over the controversial post-brexit protocol is imminent. the tory leader is joined by northern ireland secretary chris heaton-harris ahead of talks with political parties in the region over the northern ireland protocol. sunak will hold talks with stormont parties and other stakeholders tomorrow. he last visited northern ireland in december and his latest visit will be seen as a signal that a deal over the trading arrangements for the region could be unveiled within days. a spokeswoman for sunak said: “whilst talks with the eu are ongoing, ministers continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure any solution fixes the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards northern ireland’s place in the uk’s internal market. “the prime minister and secretary of state for northern ireland are travelling to northern ireland this evening to speak to political parties as part of this engagement process.” however, a senior dup figure has warned that a failure to end the imposition of eu law in northern ireland in any new uk/eu deal on post-brexit trade will ensure stormont’s power-sharing impasse continues. nigel dodds insisted his party would maintain its block on devolution if an agreement falls short of the measures contained within the uk government’s own stalled draft legislation to unilaterally rip up the contentious northern ireland protocol. the northern ireland protocol bill includes provisions that would remove the oversight of the european court of justice (ecj) in the region. while it is understood the eu and uk are close to signing off a deal that would reduce protocol red tape on the movement of goods from britain to northern ireland, there is no expectation that brussels is willing to agree to ending the application of eu law in the region. the eu contends a fundamental plank of the protocol – namely that northern ireland traders can sell freely into the european single market – is dependent on the operation of eu rules in region. speculation is intensifying that a deal could be unveiled imminently, potentially early next week. advertisement following his visit to northern ireland, sunak is set to join european leaders in germany this weekend for the munich security conference and the protocol is likely to feature in discussions on the margins. dodds, a former deputy leader of the dup who now leads the party in the uk’s house of lords, said the continued application of eu law in northern ireland would not be acceptable to his party. his comments, and similar remarks from other senior colleagues, suggest a new deal between the eu and uk may not ultimately be enough to convince the dup to return to power-sharing at stormont. the dup is currently blocking the functioning of the devolved institutions in belfast in protest at the protocol. in 2021, the dup set out seven tests by which it will judge changes to the protocol. those tests did not include a specific reference to ecj oversight. nationalist mp claire hanna from the sdlp said removal of single market access would have serious ramifications in northern ireland, particularly in relation to the agri-food sector that involves so much cross border movement of goods on the island of ireland. she said it looked like an eu/uk deal on the protocol was “imminent”. “i think we’ve all heard the rumours that the deal has been done and sitting there and i think it’s

So what’s happened with migration since then?\n",
       "The honest answer is that we don’t know with any certainty, especially not since the pandemic struck. The number of British citizens in the EU is contested, while the UK’s Office for National Statisticsadmits“we can’t simply count people in and out at the border”.\n",
       "EU free movement laws allow citizens of each member country to move visa-free for work and study. There are some restrictions – the Irish authorities invoke them to remove a few dozen EU citizens from the country every year -  but it’s much, much easier than normal immigration procedures.\n",
       "Brexit heralded the end of free movement between the UK and the EU. Or rather, most of the EU: free movement between Ireland and the UK continues under the Common Travel Area.\n",
       "Unlike the EU version, free movement in these islands isn’t guaranteed by a binding treaty: it’s a more organic, informal arrangement. But while some expertsworrythat the Common Travel Area isn’t neat and tidy, it’s seen EU-UK free movement come and go, and means that visa-free migration continues for Irish citizens moving to Britain and vice versa.\n",
       "Although the vote for Brexit (andagainst immigration) took place on 23 June 2016, the door didn’t actually slam shut until 31 December 2020. Until then, free movement continued as before despite the referendum while withdrawal negotiations dragged on and then under a transition period.\n",
       "The very fact of the vote was initially and anecdotally credited with sparking a “Brexodus” of Europeans from Britain, and persuading others not to come in the first place.\n",
       "“Within our own membership many people left the UK and returned to the EU”, says Luke Piper of EU citizens’ campaign group The3Million. “The UK’s decision to leave did make many people feel unwelcome”.\n",
       "Researchers have found plenty of people reconsidering their place in Brexit Britain. In onerecent surveyof 2,400 people, 59% said that it “increased the likelihood of them leaving the UK”.\n",
       "However among an overall EU population numbering in the millions, “we have not seen a great ‘Brexodus’”, says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. “Most EU citizens in the UK are settled, have jobs and lives in the UK, and have remained, despite the political changes”.\n",
       "While British migration data isnotoriously unreliable, the best estimates available show a modest increase in emigration since the referendum. In the year to March 2016, just before the referendum, anestimated220,000 EU citizens departed. That rose to 250,000 in the year to March 2020.\n",
       "Meanwhile,over 5 millionhave now been granted permission to stay under the EU Settlement Scheme. Not all still live in the UK – some will be hedging their bets – but the overwhelming majority of existing residents were able to stay if they wanted to and knew about the scheme.\n",
       "As one European residenttold researchersat the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank:\n",
       "“I am against Brexit. I think it will be horrible for the economy. But I will go down with the ship. This is where I feel at home and I would be devastated if I had to leave”.\n",
       "Estimated immigration has fallen more steadily and significantly, down from 500,000 a year to a pre-pandemic 366,000.\n",
       "Again, the official stats are quite ropey, and the specific numbers are probably wrong. But even allowing a massive margin for error, it seems that more EU citizens came to the UK than left, despite Brexit undoubtedly leaving a sour taste for some.\n",
       "“Overall”, says McNeil “the UK’s EU migrant population has continued to grow (though much more slowly), rather than to decrease”.\n",
       "The combined effect of slightly higher emigration and lower immigration still adds up to a significant slowdown. Putting it all down to a direct Brexit effect is trickier, though: there were other things calling migrants home between 2016 and 2020.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "“Factors such as the fall in the value of the pound relative to the Euro and the Zloty following the referendum; the increasing economic opportunities in various EU member states, including Poland; and concerns about long term opportunities in the UK after Brexit are all potentially factors that may have affected people’s choices”, McNeil tellsThe Journal.\n",
       "“There is no particular evidence that post-Brexit administrative factors had a significant role to play, and little to suggest that stigmatisation of foreign workers was a major driver of emigration or of the fall in immigration”.\n",
       "The British authorities have even less idea of what’s happened since free movement ended. The Office for National Statisticssays: “There has been speculation that during 2020 and 2021 there was an exodus of people – particularly EU citizens – leaving the UK to go and live elsewhere. Did this actually happen? Simply put, we don’t know yet”.\n",
       "That’s because the pandemic has playedmerry hellwith the already unreliable records on migration and the foreign population, including an airport survey that had run continuously since 1961 but fell victim to Covid.\n",
       "Professor Alan Manning of the London School of Economics says that “although estimates that the number of migrants in the UK fell by 1.3m have now been largely discredited, some European workers have returned home”. On the other side of the balance sheet,very fewhave been applying for work visas under the new immigration system.\n",
       "The latest employment figuresrecorded 200,000fewer EU workers in the UK than pre-pandemic, while the ONS hastentatively recordedan overall population fall of 110,000 in 2020.\n",
       "But because the end of free movement coincided with the pandemic, the Migration Observatory’s Madeleine Sumption insists that “it is still too early to assess the impacts what the impacts of the new immigration system have been”.\n",
       "If EU migration to the UK is a bit hazy, the picture for British migration to and from the EU is a positive pea-souper fog.\n",
       "“We just don’t know that at the moment”, laments Professor Michaela Benson of Lancaster University, an expert on British emigrants. “At the moment, when we’re doing research, we’re using statistics that are out of date by five or six years”.\n",
       "According to the European Parliament, EU records showed “about 857 000 UK citizens in the EU at the beginning of 2019; however, the actual number is estimated to be much higher, with some pointing to 1.2 million UK nationals in the EU”.\n",
       "The 1.2 million figure comes from the United Nations. The British ONS doesn’t like the way that’s calculated, and have come up with amethod of their own. Benson’s “Brexit Brits Abroad” project has said that, on a wider definition of who is a migrant, it could be as high as3.6 million.\n",
       "Disagreement on the number of British citizens living in the EU at any one time means that it’s next to impossible to get a sense of how migration patterns have changed due to Brexit.\n",
       "A good chunk of the British emigrant population lives in Ireland – over 100,000, Benson says. “The only migrant group, of any nationality, that exceeded the British in Ireland was Polish”.\n",
       "Thanks to the Common Travel Area, that cohort has been largely spared the Brexit worries of their counterparts in France and Spain.\n",
       "British residents of mainland European countries have been able to get residence permits, although the system varies from country to country. In some, including Spain, Germany and Italy, residence rights are rolled over automatically (terms and conditions apply).\n",
       "In France and a dozen other countries, people have to apply for the right to stay, like their compatriots in the UK. All have deadlines that have either already passed or will by the end of 2021.\n",
       "But the end of free movement means that even existing residents won’t have the pre-Brexit right to hop from country to country within the EU. British nationals will need to get visas in future: what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\n",
       "Not everyone seems prepared for that reality. Piper recounts “a conversation with a Brit who is wanting to move to Greece to do the whole ‘new life in a new country thing’. I asked if they’d checked what immigration and other rules they needed to satisfy. They were astonished”.\n",
       "“The fact that Britain has left the European Union is not going to stop people moving”, Benson says. “It’s just going to change the conditions under which people move and that, in turn, will change the shape of those migrations”. How exactly remains to be seen.\n",

</td><td>2022-02-15</td><td>NA</td><td>the value of goods exported from ireland rose to its highest level ever last year, powered by medical and pharmaceutical products and as cross-border trade surged. figures released by the central statistics office (cso) today show €165 billion worth of goods were exported from ireland last year. this is the highest total on record and an increase of €3 billion (2%) over 2020. medical and pharmaceutical products continued to dominate ireland’s trade, accounting for 38% of all exports to the tune of €62 billion. the most eye-catching increases were seen in goods travelling to and from northern ireland. imports from the north rose by 65% to €3.9 billion while exports rose by 54% to €3.7 billion. the statistics arefurther evidenceof brexit fuelling a boom in goods travelling in both directions across the border. meanwhile, the amount of goods arriving from britain fell by 13% to €15.4 billion. exports to britain – which make up 9% of ireland’s exports – did not suffer the same fate, instead rising by 17% to €14.4 billion. advertisement due to the northern ireland protocol of the brexit agreement, trade with britain is subject to customs checks. however, the protocol effectively means northern ireland remains within the european union single market for the movement of goods while also being part of the uk customs territory. the total share of exports (left) and imports (right) by region.csocso exports to eu countries – which account for 37% of irish exports – fell by 4% to €61.5 billion. ireland still exports far more to the eu than it ships in as eu imports rose by 13% last year to €24.3 billion. this accounts for 33% of all imports. exports to non-eu countries were valued at €103.8 billion, an increase of €5.8 billion (6%). the usa was the largest export destination, accounting for €52 billion (32%) of total exports. imports also jumped compared with 2020, growing by 18% to €102 billion. it is the first time imports have exceeded the €100 billion milestone for the year. the amount of mineral fuels – such as petrol, gas and coal – being brought into ireland increased by 82% last year, to €6.1 billion, as the economy reopened. imports from non-eu countries totalled €68 billion in 2021, an increase of €11 billion (20%) on 2020. readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of

       "Under the Nationality and Borders Bill any non-Irish or non-UK citizens would need to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to enter the UK, including Northern Ireland.\n",
       "The bill is currently going through the House of Commons.\n",
       "Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty raised the matter with Varadkar in the Dáil today, saying it was a “disgrace”, claiming it threatened livelihoods and the tourism sector in the north-west and placed stress on residents.\n",
       "“It undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area and Ireland once again faces the prospect of the collateral damage of a Tory government in Westminster that doesn’t give a damn about Ireland and it’s so divorced from the reality of life on the border that it could even countenance such a measure like this,” he said.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "He pressed Varadkar to “make it absolutely clear to the British government that this is not on”.\n",
       "The Tánaiste said the Irish government would communicate its concerns and objections to the measure to the UK.\n",
       "“Unfortunately, it doesn’t come as a huge surprise,” he said.\n",
       "“If you recall, part of the argument in favour of Brexit was about controlling their borders, and also about reducing and stopping immigration from the European Union, and this is part of the outworking of that.\n",
       "“It may be the case that some people who voted for Brexit didn’t realise that but it is part of the outworking of Brexit that the United Kingdom is going to harden its borders and is going to reduce immigration, including from the European Union.\n",
       "“Ending free movement was a big part of the argument that they made. But we will absolutely be making our views known.”\n",

to cross the irish border. under the nationality and borders bill any non-irish or non-uk citizens would need to apply for an electronic travel authorisation (eta) to enter the uk, including northern ireland. the bill is currently going through the house of commons. sinn féin td pearse doherty raised the matter with varadkar in the dáil today, saying it was a “disgrace”, claiming it threatened livelihoods and the tourism sector in the north-west and placed stress on residents. “it undermines the good friday agreement and the common travel area and ireland once again faces the prospect of the collateral damage of a tory government in westminster that doesn’t give a damn about ireland and it’s so divorced from the reality of life on the border that it could even countenance such a measure like this,” he said. advertisement he pressed varadkar to “make it absolutely clear to the british government that this is not on”. the tánaiste said the irish government would communicate its concerns and objections to the measure to the uk. “unfortunately, it doesn’t come as a huge surprise,” he said. “if you recall, part of the argument in favour of brexit was about controlling their borders, and also about reducing and stopping immigration from the european union, and this is part of the outworking of that. “it may be the case that some people who voted for brexit didn’t realise that but it is part of the outworking of brexit that the united kingdom is going to harden its borders and is going to reduce immigration, including from the european union. “ending free movement was a big part of the argument that they made. but we will absolutely be making our views known.” readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting

       "Any extension would lead to more uncertainty and was not a “solution”, according to Kevin Foster, despite calls from campaigners to push back the date amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
       "EU citizens and their families have been asked to apply to the Home Office scheme by 30 June, in order to continue living and working in the UK now the Brexit transition period and freedom of movement has ended.\n",
       "Speaking to reporters a week before the cut-off for applications, Foster said: “The EUSS has been open publicly since March 2019. We believe this has given people plenty of time to apply.\n",
       "“The sheer fact there have been over 5.6 million applications by the end of last month is testament to this.\n",
       "“I want to be clear – we will not be extending the deadline. Put simply, extending the deadline is not a solution in itself to reaching those people who have not yet applied and we would just be in a position further down the line where we would be asked to extend again, creating even more uncertainty.”\n",
       "His comments came after Downing Street said it was trying to identify tens of thousands of Europeans living in the UK who are yet to apply for the post-Brexit residency scheme.\n",
       "This followed concerns that many EU citizens – as well as nationals of Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – could have their benefits cut off if they miss the deadline.\n",
       "Number 10 insisted only a “small minority” are yet to come forward but initial official estimates on the number of anticipated applications have already been exceeded.\n",
       "Ultimately it is not known how many people who are eligible to apply are living in the UK, or how many could remain in the country undocumented.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "Around 400,000 applications are still waiting to be processed and the Home Office is receiving between 10,000 and 12,000 applications a day.\n",
       "Foster said he was “concerned” over claims that outstanding cases were facing a legal limbo or facing a cliff edge – dismissing them as “just untrue”.\n",
       "The UK Government has pledged that anyone who applies by the deadline will have their existing rights protected, subject to the decision and any appeal.\n",
       "Those who have made a valid submission will have access to a certificate of application while they await their decision, Foster said.\n",
       "It typically takes around five working days for complete applications to be processed, but it can take longer than a month if more information is needed.\n",
       "The Home Office has not committed to completing all applications by 30 June and is allowing people to make a late application if they meet “reasonable grounds” for missing the deadline.\n",
       "These include:\n",
       "Late applications can take place years afterwards. For example, if a child discovered later in life that they are undocumented.\n",
       "Addressing claims EU citizens could be removed or have their benefits taken away on 1 1 July, Foster said: “We are taking a proportionate and pragmatic approach” and insisted no action would be taken against anyone who has an outstanding application.\n",
       "He revealed immigration enforcement officers will be given powers to issue a 28-day notice to anyone they discover who may be eligible for the scheme but cannot prove their immigration status. This will tell them to take urgent action to establish their lawful status by applying to the scheme.\n",
       "These may be handed out, for example, to workers discovered during immigrations raids on businesses.\n",
       "Questions still remain over whether those whose applications are rejected, or fail to apply despite requests to do so, would then face removal from the country or be asked to leave voluntarily.\n",

will not be extending the deadline for the eu settlement scheme, an immigration minister has said. any extension would lead to more uncertainty and was not a “solution”, according to kevin foster, despite calls from campaigners to push back the date amid the coronavirus pandemic. eu citizens and their families have been asked to apply to the home office scheme by 30 june, in order to continue living and working in the uk now the brexit transition period and freedom of movement has ended. speaking to reporters a week before the cut-off for applications, foster said: “the euss has been open publicly since march 2019. we believe this has given people plenty of time to apply. “the sheer fact there have been over 5.6 million applications by the end of last month is testament to this. “i want to be clear – we will not be extending the deadline. put simply, extending the deadline is not a solution in itself to reaching those people who have not yet applied and we would just be in a position further down the line where we would be asked to extend again, creating even more uncertainty.” his comments came after downing street said it was trying to identify tens of thousands of europeans living in the uk who are yet to apply for the post-brexit residency scheme. this followed concerns that many eu citizens – as well as nationals of iceland, lichtenstein, norway and switzerland – could have their benefits cut off if they miss the deadline. number 10 insisted only a “small minority” are yet to come forward but initial official estimates on the number of anticipated applications have already been exceeded. ultimately it is not known how many people who are eligible to apply are living in the uk, or how many could remain in the country undocumented. advertisement around 400,000 applications are still waiting to be processed and the home office is receiving between 10,000 and 12,000 applications a day. foster said he was “concerned” over claims that outstanding cases were facing a legal limbo or facing a cliff edge – dismissing them as “just untrue”. the uk government has pledged that anyone who applies by the deadline will have their existing rights protected, subject to the decision and any appeal. those who have made a valid submission will have access to a certificate of application while they await their decision, foster said. it typically takes around five working days for complete applications to be processed, but it can take longer than a month if more information is needed. the home office has not committed to completing all applications by 30 june and is allowing people to make a late application if they meet “reasonable grounds” for missing the deadline. these include: late applications can take place years afterwards. for example, if a child discovered later in life that they are undocumented. addressing claims eu citizens could be removed or have their benefits taken away on 1 1 july, foster said: “we are taking a proportionate and pragmatic approach” and insisted no action would be taken against anyone who has an outstanding application. he revealed immigration enforcement officers will be given powers to issue a 28-day notice to anyone they discover who may be eligible for the scheme but cannot prove their immigration status. this will tell them to take urgent action to establish their lawful status by applying to the scheme. these may be handed out, for example, to workers discovered during immigrations raids on businesses. questions still remain over whether those whose applications are rejected, or fail to apply despite requests to do so, would then face removal from the country or be asked to leave voluntarily. readers like you are keeping these stories free for

       "London, Belfast and Dublin were blindsided by a recent attempt by the European Commission to invoke Article 16, in a row over the supply of vaccines to Europe.\n",
       "The Article overrides part of the Northern Ireland Protocol which prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, and was intended as an emergency measure not to be used.\n",
       "The European Commission backtracked on the decision, but it has caused massive political fallout, particularly in the North.\n",
       "European Affairs Minister Thomas Byrne said the Government is seeking a new safety clause, to prevent a repeat of those events.\n",
       "He told the Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs: “The reaction of Government that day was complete shock and surprise, and with no knowledge of what was being planned.\n",
       "“We had spent the previous few weeks being asked about Article 16 from another perspective, and quite rightly pointing out that this was a pretty standard safeguarding clause in the trade agreement.\n",
       "“And not designed to either eliminate the protocol or not designed to be used, except in the most extreme circumstances.”\n",
       "He said the Government is continuing to engage on multiple levels with the European Commission and the UK Government to find a resolution.\n",
       "Byrne added: “What the Government wants fundamentally is an early warning system to be put in place.\n",
       "“There is a view, and it’s a risky view, that, yes, the Commission made a mistake, yes the Commission acknowledged its mistake, and that is everything solved now.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "“Clearly that’s not the case because the consequences of this are continuing.”\n",
       "Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond questioned if the damage caused by the incident was fully appreciated by the EU.\n",
       "He said: “I think the damage has been lasting. I think what we saw in the days after was that people leapt at the opportunity where a mistake was made.\n",
       "“Are the British government now in danger of pushing this too far? We see extra demands, we see a consistent underlining that they are now preparing to trigger Article 16.\n",
       "“We look at the, albeit typical British newspapers, and they’re demanding a renegotiation less than six weeks after the trade deal was agreed.\n",
       "“I’m very worried that less than six weeks in, people are really damaging the house of cards.”\n",
       "But Byrne said that despite the damage caused, Article 16 will not be removed from the protocol.\n",
       "He said: “Even the Article 16 invocation, or attempted invocation, a couple of weeks ago didn’t eliminate the protocol.\n",
       "“The protocol is still there to avoid a hard border on the island, to make sure people and goods can move freely and that Northern Ireland remains part of the single market of the European Union.”\n",
       "Irish officials are meeting with senior figures in the European Commission on Tuesday to discuss mechanisms to avoid a repeat of the Article 16 affair.\n",
       "Byrne said he would not describe the engagement as a “key crunch meeting”.\n",
       "He added: “There will be ongoing engagements. We may not have resolution on this today, but I think safe to say at the moment, people are fully aware the significance of what has transpired.”\n",

european union affairs: “the reaction of government that day was complete shock and surprise, and with no knowledge of what was being planned. “we had spent the previous few weeks being asked about article 16 from another perspective, and quite rightly pointing out that this was a pretty standard safeguarding clause in the trade agreement. “and not designed to either eliminate the protocol or not designed to be used, except in the most extreme circumstances.” he said the government is continuing to engage on multiple levels with the european commission and the uk government to find a resolution. byrne added: “what the government wants fundamentally is an early warning system to be put in place. “there is a view, and it’s a risky view, that, yes, the commission made a mistake, yes the commission acknowledged its mistake, and that is everything solved now. advertisement “clearly that’s not the case because the consequences of this are continuing.” fine gael td neale richmond questioned if the damage caused by the incident was fully appreciated by the eu. he said: “i think the damage has been lasting. i think what we saw in the days after was that people leapt at the opportunity where a mistake was made. “are the british government now in danger of pushing this too far? we see extra demands, we see a consistent underlining that they are now preparing to trigger article 16. “we look at the, albeit typical british newspapers, and they’re demanding a renegotiation less than six weeks after the trade deal was agreed. “i’m very worried that less than six weeks in, people are really damaging the house of cards.” but byrne said that despite the damage caused, article 16 will not be removed from the protocol. he said: “even the article 16 invocation, or attempted invocation, a couple of weeks ago didn’t eliminate the protocol. “the protocol is still there to avoid a hard border on the island, to make sure people and goods can move freely and that northern ireland remains part of the single market of the european union.” irish officials are meeting with senior figures in the european commission on tuesday to discuss mechanisms to avoid a repeat of the article 16 affair. byrne said he would not describe the engagement as a “key crunch meeting”. he added: “there will be ongoing engagements. we may not have resolution on this today, but i think safe to say at the moment, people are fully aware the significance of what has transpired.” readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting

       "BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Rishi Sunak has travelled to the North ahead of talks with Stormont politicians amid growing speculation that a deal between the UK and EU over the controversial post-Brexit Protocol is imminent.\n",
       "The Tory leader is joined by Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris ahead of talks with political parties in the region over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n",
       "Sunak will hold talks with Stormont parties and other stakeholders tomorrow.\n",
       "He last visited Northern Ireland in December and his latest visit will be seen as a signal that a deal over the trading arrangements for the region could be unveiled within days.\n",
       "A spokeswoman for Sunak said: “Whilst talks with the EU are ongoing, ministers continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure any solution fixes the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.\n",
       "“The Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland are travelling to Northern Ireland this evening to speak to political parties as part of this engagement process.”\n",
       "However, a senior DUP figure has warned that a failure to end the imposition of EU law in Northern Ireland in any new UK/EU deal on post-Brexit trade will ensure Stormont’s power-sharing impasse continues.\n",
       "Nigel Dodds insisted his party would maintain its block on devolution if an agreement falls short of the measures contained within the UK Government’s own stalled draft legislation to unilaterally rip up the contentious Northern Ireland Protocol.\n",
       "The Northern Ireland Protocol Bill includes provisions that would remove the oversight of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the region.\n",
       "While it is understood the EU and UK are close to signing off a deal that would reduce Protocol red tape on the movement of goods from Britain to Northern Ireland, there is no expectation that Brussels is willing to agree to ending the application of EU law in the region.\n",
       "The EU contends a fundamental plank of the Protocol – namely that Northern Ireland traders can sell freely into the European single market – is dependent on the operation of EU rules in region.\n",
       "Speculation is intensifying that a deal could be unveiled imminently, potentially early next week.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "Following his visit to Northern Ireland, Sunak is set to join European leaders in Germany this weekend for the Munich Security Conference and the protocol is likely to feature in discussions on the margins.\n",
       "Dodds, a former deputy leader of the DUP who now leads the party in the UK’s House of Lords, said the continued application of EU law in Northern Ireland would not be acceptable to his party.\n",
       "His comments, and similar remarks from other senior colleagues, suggest a new deal between the EU and UK may not ultimately be enough to convince the DUP to return to power-sharing at Stormont.\n",
       "The DUP is currently blocking the functioning of the devolved institutions in Belfast in protest at the protocol.\n",
       "In 2021, the DUP set out seven tests by which it will judge changes to the protocol. Those tests did not include a specific reference to ECJ oversight.\n",
       "Nationalist MP Claire Hanna from the SDLP said removal of single market access would have serious ramifications in Northern Ireland, particularly in relation to the agri-food sector that involves so much cross border movement of goods on the island of Ireland.\n",
       "She said it looked like an EU/UK deal on the protocol was “imminent”.\n",
       "“I think we’ve all heard the rumours that the deal has been done and sitting there and I think it’s positive, it’s less friction and maintaining of dual market access, so I think that’s a win for this region,” she said.\n",
       "Hanna told BBC Radio Ulster that the DUP should be challenged to explain what the consequences would be if EU law was removed in Northern Ireland.\n",
       "“What they mean, and they should be forced to spell it out, what they mean is they don’t want us to have access to the single market and not only is that something that is completely rejected by a substantial number of parties and the majority of our MLAs, it means no dual market access that even the DUP lauded at the inception of the protocol, and it means no integrated economy,” she said.\n",
       "“It essentially means no agri-food economy, it means massive disruption to dairy (industry) and many of those other issues.”\n",
       "She added: “I think there are people in the DUP who know they are on a hiding to nothing if they keep going further down this dark alley.\n",
       "“We know this is hard, compromise is hard, none of the options are particularly brilliant, but just saying ‘no’ is no longer an option.”

the north ahead of talks with stormont politicians amid growing speculation that a deal between the uk and eu over the controversial post-brexit protocol is imminent. the tory leader is joined by northern ireland secretary chris heaton-harris ahead of talks with political parties in the region over the northern ireland protocol. sunak will hold talks with stormont parties and other stakeholders tomorrow. he last visited northern ireland in december and his latest visit will be seen as a signal that a deal over the trading arrangements for the region could be unveiled within days. a spokeswoman for sunak said: “whilst talks with the eu are ongoing, ministers continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure any solution fixes the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards northern ireland’s place in the uk’s internal market. “the prime minister and secretary of state for northern ireland are travelling to northern ireland this evening to speak to political parties as part of this engagement process.” however, a senior dup figure has warned that a failure to end the imposition of eu law in northern ireland in any new uk/eu deal on post-brexit trade will ensure stormont’s power-sharing impasse continues. nigel dodds insisted his party would maintain its block on devolution if an agreement falls short of the measures contained within the uk government’s own stalled draft legislation to unilaterally rip up the contentious northern ireland protocol. the northern ireland protocol bill includes provisions that would remove the oversight of the european court of justice (ecj) in the region. while it is understood the eu and uk are close to signing off a deal that would reduce protocol red tape on the movement of goods from britain to northern ireland, there is no expectation that brussels is willing to agree to ending the application of eu law in the region. the eu contends a fundamental plank of the protocol – namely that northern ireland traders can sell freely into the european single market – is dependent on the operation of eu rules in region. speculation is intensifying that a deal could be unveiled imminently, potentially early next week. advertisement following his visit to northern ireland, sunak is set to join european leaders in germany this weekend for the munich security conference and the protocol is likely to feature in discussions on the margins. dodds, a former deputy leader of the dup who now leads the party in the uk’s house of lords, said the continued application of eu law in northern ireland would not be acceptable to his party. his comments, and similar remarks from other senior colleagues, suggest a new deal between the eu and uk may not ultimately be enough to convince the dup to return to power-sharing at stormont. the dup is currently blocking the functioning of the devolved institutions in belfast in protest at the protocol. in 2021, the dup set out seven tests by which it will judge changes to the protocol. those tests did not include a specific reference to ecj oversight. nationalist mp claire hanna from the sdlp said removal of single market access would have serious ramifications in northern ireland, particularly in relation to the agri-food sector that involves so much cross border movement of goods on the island of ireland. she said it looked like an eu/uk deal on the protocol was “imminent”. “i think we’ve all heard the rumours that the deal has been done and sitting there and i think it’s positive, it’s less friction and maintaining of dual market access, so i think that’s a win for this region,” she said. hanna told bbc radio ulster that the dup should be challenged to explain what the consequences would be if eu law was removed in northern ireland. “what they mean, and they should be forced to spell it out, what they mean is they don’t want us to have access to the single market and not only is that something that is completely rejected by a substantial number of parties and the majority of our mlas, it means no dual market access that even the dup lauded at the inception of the protocol, and it means no integrated economy,” she said. “it essentially means no agri-food economy, it means massive disruption to dairy (industry) and many of those other issues.” she added: “i think there are people in the dup who know they are on a hiding to nothing if they keep going further down this dark alley. “we know this is hard, compromise is hard, none of the options are particularly brilliant, but just saying ‘no’ is no longer an option.”

       "The honest answer is that we don’t know with any certainty, especially not since the pandemic struck. The number of British citizens in the EU is contested, while the UK’s Office for National Statisticsadmits“we can’t simply count people in and out at the border”.\n",
       "EU free movement laws allow citizens of each member country to move visa-free for work and study. There are some restrictions – the Irish authorities invoke them to remove a few dozen EU citizens from the country every year -  but it’s much, much easier than normal immigration procedures.\n",
       "Brexit heralded the end of free movement between the UK and the EU. Or rather, most of the EU: free movement between Ireland and the UK continues under the Common Travel Area.\n",
       "Unlike the EU version, free movement in these islands isn’t guaranteed by a binding treaty: it’s a more organic, informal arrangement. But while some expertsworrythat the Common Travel Area isn’t neat and tidy, it’s seen EU-UK free movement come and go, and means that visa-free migration continues for Irish citizens moving to Britain and vice versa.\n",
       "Although the vote for Brexit (andagainst immigration) took place on 23 June 2016, the door didn’t actually slam shut until 31 December 2020. Until then, free movement continued as before despite the referendum while withdrawal negotiations dragged on and then under a transition period.\n",
       "The very fact of the vote was initially and anecdotally credited with sparking a “Brexodus” of Europeans from Britain, and persuading others not to come in the first place.\n",
       "“Within our own membership many people left the UK and returned to the EU”, says Luke Piper of EU citizens’ campaign group The3Million. “The UK’s decision to leave did make many people feel unwelcome”.\n",
       "Researchers have found plenty of people reconsidering their place in Brexit Britain. In onerecent surveyof 2,400 people, 59\\% said that it “increased the likelihood of them leaving the UK”.\n",
       "However among an overall EU population numbering in the millions, “we have not seen a great ‘Brexodus’”, says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. “Most EU citizens in the UK are settled, have jobs and lives in the UK, and have remained, despite the political changes”.\n",
       "While British migration data isnotoriously unreliable, the best estimates available show a modest increase in emigration since the referendum. In the year to March 2016, just before the referendum, anestimated220,000 EU citizens departed. That rose to 250,000 in the year to March 2020.\n",
       "Meanwhile,over 5 millionhave now been granted permission to stay under the EU Settlement Scheme. Not all still live in the UK – some will be hedging their bets – but the overwhelming majority of existing residents were able to stay if they wanted to and knew about the scheme.\n",
       "As one European residenttold researchersat the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank:\n",
       "“I am against Brexit. I think it will be horrible for the economy. But I will go down with the ship. This is where I feel at home and I would be devastated if I had to leave”.\n",
       "Estimated immigration has fallen more steadily and significantly, down from 500,000 a year to a pre-pandemic 366,000.\n",
       "Again, the official stats are quite ropey, and the specific numbers are probably wrong. But even allowing a massive margin for error, it seems that more EU citizens came to the UK than left, despite Brexit undoubtedly leaving a sour taste for some.\n",
       "“Overall”, says McNeil “the UK’s EU migrant population has continued to grow (though much more slowly), rather than to decrease”.\n",
       "The combined effect of slightly higher emigration and lower immigration still adds up to a significant slowdown. Putting it all down to a direct Brexit effect is trickier, though: there were other things calling migrants home between 2016 and 2020.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "“Factors such as the fall in the value of the pound relative to the Euro and the Zloty following the referendum; the increasing economic opportunities in various EU member states, including Poland; and concerns about long term opportunities in the UK after Brexit are all potentially factors that may have affected people’s choices”, McNeil tellsThe Journal.\n",
       "“There is no particular evidence that post-Brexit administrative factors had a significant role to play, and little to suggest that stigmatisation of foreign workers was a major driver of emigration or of the fall in immigration”.\n",
       "The British authorities have even less idea of what’s happened since free movement ended. The Office for National Statisticssays: “There has been speculation that during 2020 and 2021 there was an exodus of people – particularly EU citizens – leaving the UK to go and live elsewhere. Did this actually happen? Simply put, we don’t know yet”.\n",
       "That’s because the pandemic has playedmerry hellwith the already unreliable records on migration and the foreign population, including an airport survey that had run continuously since 1961 but fell victim to Covid.\n",
       "Professor Alan Manning of the London School of Economics says that “although estimates that the number of migrants in the UK fell by 1.3m have now been largely discredited, some European workers have returned home”. On the other side of the balance sheet,very fewhave been applying for work visas under the new immigration system.\n",
       "The latest employment figuresrecorded 200,000fewer EU workers in the UK than pre-pandemic, while the ONS hastentatively recordedan overall population fall of 110,000 in 2020.\n",
       "But because the end of free movement coincided with the pandemic, the Migration Observatory’s Madeleine Sumption insists that “it is still too early to assess the impacts what the impacts of the new immigration system have been”.\n",
       "If EU migration to the UK is a bit hazy, the picture for British migration to and from the EU is a positive pea-souper fog.\n",
       "“We just don’t know that at the moment”, laments Professor Michaela Benson of Lancaster University, an expert on British emigrants. “At the moment, when we’re doing research, we’re using statistics that are out of date by five or six years”.\n",
       "According to the European Parliament, EU records showed “about 857 000 UK citizens in the EU at the beginning of 2019; however, the actual number is estimated to be much higher, with some pointing to 1.2 million UK nationals in the EU”.\n",
       "The 1.2 million figure comes from the United Nations. The British ONS doesn’t like the way that’s calculated, and have come up with amethod of their own. Benson’s “Brexit Brits Abroad” project has said that, on a wider definition of who is a migrant, it could be as high as3.6 million.\n",
       "Disagreement on the number of British citizens living in the EU at any one time means that it’s next to impossible to get a sense of how migration patterns have changed due to Brexit.\n",
       "A good chunk of the British emigrant population lives in Ireland – over 100,000, Benson says. “The only migrant group, of any nationality, that exceeded the British in Ireland was Polish”.\n",
       "Thanks to the Common Travel Area, that cohort has been largely spared the Brexit worries of their counterparts in France and Spain.\n",
       "British residents of mainland European countries have been able to get residence permits, although the system varies from country to country. In some, including Spain, Germany and Italy, residence rights are rolled over automatically (terms and conditions apply).\n",
       "In France and a dozen other countries, people have to apply for the right to stay, like their compatriots in the UK. All have deadlines that have either already passed or will by the end of 2021.\n",
       "But the end of free movement means that even existing residents won’t have the pre-Brexit right to hop from country to country within the EU. British nationals will need to get visas in future: what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\n",
       "Not everyone seems prepared for that reality. Piper recounts “a conversation with a Brit who is wanting to move to Greece to do the whole ‘new life in a new country thing’. I asked if they’d checked what immigration and other rules they needed to satisfy. They were astonished”.\n",
       "“The fact that Britain has left the European Union is not going to stop people moving”, Benson says. “It’s just going to change the conditions under which people move and that, in turn, will change the shape of those migrations”. How exactly remains to be seen.\n",

& the value of goods exported from ireland rose to its highest level ever last year, powered by medical and pharmaceutical products and as cross-border trade surged. figures released by the central statistics office (cso) today show €165 billion worth of goods were exported from ireland last year. this is the highest total on record and an increase of €3 billion (2\\%) over 2020. medical and pharmaceutical products continued to dominate ireland’s trade, accounting for 38\\% of all exports to the tune of €62 billion. the most eye-catching increases were seen in goods travelling to and from northern ireland. imports from the north rose by 65\\% to €3.9 billion while exports rose by 54\\% to €3.7 billion. the statistics arefurther evidenceof brexit fuelling a boom in goods travelling in both directions across the border. meanwhile, the amount of goods arriving from britain fell by 13\\% to €15.4 billion. exports to britain – which make up 9\\% of ireland’s exports – did not suffer the same fate, instead rising by 17\\% to €14.4 billion. advertisement due to the northern ireland protocol of the brexit agreement, trade with britain is subject to customs checks. however, the protocol effectively means northern ireland remains within the european union single market for the movement of goods while also being part of the uk customs territory. the total share of exports (left) and imports (right) by region.csocso exports to eu countries – which account for 37\\% of irish exports – fell by 4\\% to €61.5 billion. ireland still exports far more to the eu than it ships in as eu imports rose by 13\\% last year to €24.3 billion. this accounts for 33\\% of all imports. exports to non-eu countries were valued at €103.8 billion, an increase of €5.8 billion (6\\%). the usa was the largest export destination, accounting for €52 billion (32\\%) of total exports. imports also jumped compared with 2020, growing by 18\\% to €102 billion. it is the first time imports have exceeded the €100 billion milestone for the year. the amount of mineral fuels – such as petrol, gas and coal – being brought into ireland increased by 82\\% last year, to €6.1 billion, as the economy reopened. imports from non-eu countries totalled €68 billion in 2021, an increase of €11 billion (20\\%) on 2020. readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising

       "\t https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-bill-visa-non-eu-citizens-northern-ireland-border-5625136-Dec2021/         & TÁNAISTE LEO VARADKAR has said he will raise concerns with the UK government over proposed post-Brexit arrangements to cross the Irish border.\n",
       "Under the Nationality and Borders Bill any non-Irish or non-UK citizens would need to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to enter the UK, including Northern Ireland.\n",
       "The bill is currently going through the House of Commons.\n",
       "Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty raised the matter with Varadkar in the Dáil today, saying it was a “disgrace”, claiming it threatened livelihoods and the tourism sector in the north-west and placed stress on residents.\n",
       "“It undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area and Ireland once again faces the prospect of the collateral damage of a Tory government in Westminster that doesn’t give a damn about Ireland and it’s so divorced from the reality of life on the border that it could even countenance such a measure like this,” he said.\n",

       "He pressed Varadkar to “make it absolutely clear to the British government that this is not on”.\n",
       "The Tánaiste said the Irish government would communicate its concerns and objections to the measure to the UK.\n",
       "“Unfortunately, it doesn’t come as a huge surprise,” he said.\n",
       "“If you recall, part of the argument in favour of Brexit was about controlling their borders, and also about reducing and stopping immigration from the European Union, and this is part of the outworking of that.\n",
       "“It may be the case that some people who voted for Brexit didn’t realise that but it is part of the outworking of Brexit that the United Kingdom is going to harden its borders and is going to reduce immigration, including from the European Union.\n",
       "“Ending free movement was a big part of the argument that they made. But we will absolutely be making our views known.”\n",

                                              & 2021-12-09 & NA & tánaiste leo varadkar has said he will raise concerns with the uk government over proposed post-brexit arrangements to cross the irish border. under the nationality and borders bill any non-irish or non-uk citizens would need to apply for an electronic travel authorisation (eta) to enter the uk, including northern ireland. the bill is currently going through the house of commons. sinn féin td pearse doherty raised the matter with varadkar in the dáil today, saying it was a “disgrace”, claiming it threatened livelihoods and the tourism sector in the north-west and placed stress on residents. “it undermines the good friday agreement and the common travel area and ireland once again faces the prospect of the collateral damage of a tory government in westminster that doesn’t give a damn about ireland and it’s so divorced from the reality of life on the border that it could even countenance such a measure like this,” he said. advertisement he pressed varadkar to “make it absolutely clear to the british government that this is not on”. the tánaiste said the irish government would communicate its concerns and objections to the measure to the uk. “unfortunately, it doesn’t come as a huge surprise,” he said. “if you recall, part of the argument in favour of brexit was about controlling their borders, and also about reducing and stopping immigration from the european union, and this is part of the outworking of that. “it may be the case that some people who voted for brexit didn’t realise that but it is part of the outworking of brexit that the united kingdom is going to harden its borders and is going to reduce immigration, including from the european union. “ending free movement was a big part of the argument that they made. but we will absolutely be making our views known.” readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting contributions

       "Any extension would lead to more uncertainty and was not a “solution”, according to Kevin Foster, despite calls from campaigners to push back the date amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
       "EU citizens and their families have been asked to apply to the Home Office scheme by 30 June, in order to continue living and working in the UK now the Brexit transition period and freedom of movement has ended.\n",
       "Speaking to reporters a week before the cut-off for applications, Foster said: “The EUSS has been open publicly since March 2019. We believe this has given people plenty of time to apply.\n",
       "“The sheer fact there have been over 5.6 million applications by the end of last month is testament to this.\n",
       "“I want to be clear – we will not be extending the deadline. Put simply, extending the deadline is not a solution in itself to reaching those people who have not yet applied and we would just be in a position further down the line where we would be asked to extend again, creating even more uncertainty.”\n",
       "His comments came after Downing Street said it was trying to identify tens of thousands of Europeans living in the UK who are yet to apply for the post-Brexit residency scheme.\n",
       "This followed concerns that many EU citizens – as well as nationals of Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – could have their benefits cut off if they miss the deadline.\n",
       "Number 10 insisted only a “small minority” are yet to come forward but initial official estimates on the number of anticipated applications have already been exceeded.\n",
       "Ultimately it is not known how many people who are eligible to apply are living in the UK, or how many could remain in the country undocumented.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "Around 400,000 applications are still waiting to be processed and the Home Office is receiving between 10,000 and 12,000 applications a day.\n",
       "Foster said he was “concerned” over claims that outstanding cases were facing a legal limbo or facing a cliff edge – dismissing them as “just untrue”.\n",
       "The UK Government has pledged that anyone who applies by the deadline will have their existing rights protected, subject to the decision and any appeal.\n",
       "Those who have made a valid submission will have access to a certificate of application while they await their decision, Foster said.\n",
       "It typically takes around five working days for complete applications to be processed, but it can take longer than a month if more information is needed.\n",
       "The Home Office has not committed to completing all applications by 30 June and is allowing people to make a late application if they meet “reasonable grounds” for missing the deadline.\n",
       "These include:\n",
       "Late applications can take place years afterwards. For example, if a child discovered later in life that they are undocumented.\n",
       "Addressing claims EU citizens could be removed or have their benefits taken away on 1 1 July, Foster said: “We are taking a proportionate and pragmatic approach” and insisted no action would be taken against anyone who has an outstanding application.\n",
       "He revealed immigration enforcement officers will be given powers to issue a 28-day notice to anyone they discover who may be eligible for the scheme but cannot prove their immigration status. This will tell them to take urgent action to establish their lawful status by applying to the scheme.\n",
       "These may be handed out, for example, to workers discovered during immigrations raids on businesses.\n",
       "Questions still remain over whether those whose applications are rejected, or fail to apply despite requests to do so, would then face removal from the country or be asked to leave voluntarily.\n",

extending the deadline for the eu settlement scheme, an immigration minister has said. any extension would lead to more uncertainty and was not a “solution”, according to kevin foster, despite calls from campaigners to push back the date amid the coronavirus pandemic. eu citizens and their families have been asked to apply to the home office scheme by 30 june, in order to continue living and working in the uk now the brexit transition period and freedom of movement has ended. speaking to reporters a week before the cut-off for applications, foster said: “the euss has been open publicly since march 2019. we believe this has given people plenty of time to apply. “the sheer fact there have been over 5.6 million applications by the end of last month is testament to this. “i want to be clear – we will not be extending the deadline. put simply, extending the deadline is not a solution in itself to reaching those people who have not yet applied and we would just be in a position further down the line where we would be asked to extend again, creating even more uncertainty.” his comments came after downing street said it was trying to identify tens of thousands of europeans living in the uk who are yet to apply for the post-brexit residency scheme. this followed concerns that many eu citizens – as well as nationals of iceland, lichtenstein, norway and switzerland – could have their benefits cut off if they miss the deadline. number 10 insisted only a “small minority” are yet to come forward but initial official estimates on the number of anticipated applications have already been exceeded. ultimately it is not known how many people who are eligible to apply are living in the uk, or how many could remain in the country undocumented. advertisement around 400,000 applications are still waiting to be processed and the home office is receiving between 10,000 and 12,000 applications a day. foster said he was “concerned” over claims that outstanding cases were facing a legal limbo or facing a cliff edge – dismissing them as “just untrue”. the uk government has pledged that anyone who applies by the deadline will have their existing rights protected, subject to the decision and any appeal. those who have made a valid submission will have access to a certificate of application while they await their decision, foster said. it typically takes around five working days for complete applications to be processed, but it can take longer than a month if more information is needed. the home office has not committed to completing all applications by 30 june and is allowing people to make a late application if they meet “reasonable grounds” for missing the deadline. these include: late applications can take place years afterwards. for example, if a child discovered later in life that they are undocumented. addressing claims eu citizens could be removed or have their benefits taken away on 1 1 july, foster said: “we are taking a proportionate and pragmatic approach” and insisted no action would be taken against anyone who has an outstanding application. he revealed immigration enforcement officers will be given powers to issue a 28-day notice to anyone they discover who may be eligible for the scheme but cannot prove their immigration status. this will tell them to take urgent action to establish their lawful status by applying to the scheme. these may be handed out, for example, to workers discovered during immigrations raids on businesses. questions still remain over whether those whose applications are rejected, or fail to apply despite requests to do so, would then face removal from the country or be asked to leave voluntarily. readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting

       "BRITISH PRIME MINISTER Rishi Sunak has travelled to the North ahead of talks with Stormont politicians amid growing speculation that a deal between the UK and EU over the controversial post-Brexit Protocol is imminent.\n",
       "The Tory leader is joined by Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris ahead of talks with political parties in the region over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\n",
       "Sunak will hold talks with Stormont parties and other stakeholders tomorrow.\n",
       "He last visited Northern Ireland in December and his latest visit will be seen as a signal that a deal over the trading arrangements for the region could be unveiled within days.\n",
       "A spokeswoman for Sunak said: “Whilst talks with the EU are ongoing, ministers continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure any solution fixes the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.\n",
       "“The Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland are travelling to Northern Ireland this evening to speak to political parties as part of this engagement process.”\n",
       "However, a senior DUP figure has warned that a failure to end the imposition of EU law in Northern Ireland in any new UK/EU deal on post-Brexit trade will ensure Stormont’s power-sharing impasse continues.\n",
       "Nigel Dodds insisted his party would maintain its block on devolution if an agreement falls short of the measures contained within the UK Government’s own stalled draft legislation to unilaterally rip up the contentious Northern Ireland Protocol.\n",
       "The Northern Ireland Protocol Bill includes provisions that would remove the oversight of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the region.\n",
       "While it is understood the EU and UK are close to signing off a deal that would reduce Protocol red tape on the movement of goods from Britain to Northern Ireland, there is no expectation that Brussels is willing to agree to ending the application of EU law in the region.\n",
       "The EU contends a fundamental plank of the Protocol – namely that Northern Ireland traders can sell freely into the European single market – is dependent on the operation of EU rules in region.\n",
       "Speculation is intensifying that a deal could be unveiled imminently, potentially early next week.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "Following his visit to Northern Ireland, Sunak is set to join European leaders in Germany this weekend for the Munich Security Conference and the protocol is likely to feature in discussions on the margins.\n",
       "Dodds, a former deputy leader of the DUP who now leads the party in the UK’s House of Lords, said the continued application of EU law in Northern Ireland would not be acceptable to his party.\n",
       "His comments, and similar remarks from other senior colleagues, suggest a new deal between the EU and UK may not ultimately be enough to convince the DUP to return to power-sharing at Stormont.\n",
       "The DUP is currently blocking the functioning of the devolved institutions in Belfast in protest at the protocol.\n",
       "In 2021, the DUP set out seven tests by which it will judge changes to the protocol. Those tests did not include a specific reference to ECJ oversight.\n",
       "Nationalist MP Claire Hanna from the SDLP said removal of single market access would have serious ramifications in Northern Ireland, particularly in relation to the agri-food sector that involves so much cross border movement of goods on the island of Ireland.\n",
       "She said it looked like an EU/UK deal on the protocol was “imminent”.\n",
       "“I think we’ve all heard the rumours that the deal has been done and sitting there and I think it’s positive, it’s less friction and maintaining of dual market access, so I think that’s a win for this region,” she said.\n",
       "Hanna told BBC Radio Ulster that the DUP should be challenged to explain what the consequences would be if EU law was removed in Northern Ireland.\n",
       "“What they mean, and they should be forced to spell it out, what they mean is they don’t want us to have access to the single market and not only is that something that is completely rejected by a substantial number of parties and the majority of our MLAs, it means no dual market access that even the DUP lauded at the inception of the protocol, and it means no integrated economy,” she said.\n",
       "“It essentially means no agri-food economy, it means massive disruption to dairy (industry) and many of those other issues.”\n",
       "She added: “I think there are people in the DUP who know they are on a hiding to nothing if they keep going further down this dark alley.\n",
       "“We know this is hard, compromise is hard, none of the options are particularly brilliant, but just saying ‘no’ is no longer an option.”

the north ahead of talks with stormont politicians amid growing speculation that a deal between the uk and eu over the controversial post-brexit protocol is imminent. the tory leader is joined by northern ireland secretary chris heaton-harris ahead of talks with political parties in the region over the northern ireland protocol. sunak will hold talks with stormont parties and other stakeholders tomorrow. he last visited northern ireland in december and his latest visit will be seen as a signal that a deal over the trading arrangements for the region could be unveiled within days. a spokeswoman for sunak said: “whilst talks with the eu are ongoing, ministers continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure any solution fixes the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards northern ireland’s place in the uk’s internal market. “the prime minister and secretary of state for northern ireland are travelling to northern ireland this evening to speak to political parties as part of this engagement process.” however, a senior dup figure has warned that a failure to end the imposition of eu law in northern ireland in any new uk/eu deal on post-brexit trade will ensure stormont’s power-sharing impasse continues. nigel dodds insisted his party would maintain its block on devolution if an agreement falls short of the measures contained within the uk government’s own stalled draft legislation to unilaterally rip up the contentious northern ireland protocol. the northern ireland protocol bill includes provisions that would remove the oversight of the european court of justice (ecj) in the region. while it is understood the eu and uk are close to signing off a deal that would reduce protocol red tape on the movement of goods from britain to northern ireland, there is no expectation that brussels is willing to agree to ending the application of eu law in the region. the eu contends a fundamental plank of the protocol – namely that northern ireland traders can sell freely into the european single market – is dependent on the operation of eu rules in region. speculation is intensifying that a deal could be unveiled imminently, potentially early next week. advertisement following his visit to northern ireland, sunak is set to join european leaders in germany this weekend for the munich security conference and the protocol is likely to feature in discussions on the margins. dodds, a former deputy leader of the dup who now leads the party in the uk’s house of lords, said the continued application of eu law in northern ireland would not be acceptable to his party. his comments, and similar remarks from other senior colleagues, suggest a new deal between the eu and uk may not ultimately be enough to convince the dup to return to power-sharing at stormont. the dup is currently blocking the functioning of the devolved institutions in belfast in protest at the protocol. in 2021, the dup set out seven tests by which it will judge changes to the protocol. those tests did not include a specific reference to ecj oversight. nationalist mp claire hanna from the sdlp said removal of single market access would have serious ramifications in northern ireland, particularly in relation to the agri-food sector that involves so much cross border movement of goods on the island of ireland. she said it looked like an eu/uk deal on the protocol was “imminent”. “i think we’ve all heard the rumours that the deal has been done and sitting there and i think it’s positive, it’s less friction and maintaining of dual market access, so i think that’s a win for this region,” she said. hanna told bbc radio ulster that the dup should be challenged to explain what the consequences would be if eu law was removed in northern ireland. “what they mean, and they should be forced to spell it out, what they mean is they don’t want us to have access to the single market and not only is that something that is completely rejected by a substantial number of parties and the majority of our mlas, it means no dual market access that even the dup lauded at the inception of the protocol, and it means no integrated economy,” she said. “it essentially means no agri-food economy, it means massive disruption to dairy (industry) and many of those other issues.” she added: “i think there are people in the dup who know they are on a hiding to nothing if they keep going further down this dark alley. “we know this is hard, compromise is hard, none of the options are particularly brilliant, but just saying ‘no’ is no longer an option.”

       "The honest answer is that we don’t know with any certainty, especially not since the pandemic struck. The number of British citizens in the EU is contested, while the UK’s Office for National Statisticsadmits“we can’t simply count people in and out at the border”.\n",
       "EU free movement laws allow citizens of each member country to move visa-free for work and study. There are some restrictions – the Irish authorities invoke them to remove a few dozen EU citizens from the country every year -  but it’s much, much easier than normal immigration procedures.\n",
       "Brexit heralded the end of free movement between the UK and the EU. Or rather, most of the EU: free movement between Ireland and the UK continues under the Common Travel Area.\n",
       "Unlike the EU version, free movement in these islands isn’t guaranteed by a binding treaty: it’s a more organic, informal arrangement. But while some expertsworrythat the Common Travel Area isn’t neat and tidy, it’s seen EU-UK free movement come and go, and means that visa-free migration continues for Irish citizens moving to Britain and vice versa.\n",
       "Although the vote for Brexit (andagainst immigration) took place on 23 June 2016, the door didn’t actually slam shut until 31 December 2020. Until then, free movement continued as before despite the referendum while withdrawal negotiations dragged on and then under a transition period.\n",
       "The very fact of the vote was initially and anecdotally credited with sparking a “Brexodus” of Europeans from Britain, and persuading others not to come in the first place.\n",
       "“Within our own membership many people left the UK and returned to the EU”, says Luke Piper of EU citizens’ campaign group The3Million. “The UK’s decision to leave did make many people feel unwelcome”.\n",
       "Researchers have found plenty of people reconsidering their place in Brexit Britain. In onerecent surveyof 2,400 people, 59% said that it “increased the likelihood of them leaving the UK”.\n",
       "However among an overall EU population numbering in the millions, “we have not seen a great ‘Brexodus’”, says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. “Most EU citizens in the UK are settled, have jobs and lives in the UK, and have remained, despite the political changes”.\n",
       "While British migration data isnotoriously unreliable, the best estimates available show a modest increase in emigration since the referendum. In the year to March 2016, just before the referendum, anestimated220,000 EU citizens departed. That rose to 250,000 in the year to March 2020.\n",
       "Meanwhile,over 5 millionhave now been granted permission to stay under the EU Settlement Scheme. Not all still live in the UK – some will be hedging their bets – but the overwhelming majority of existing residents were able to stay if they wanted to and knew about the scheme.\n",
       "As one European residenttold researchersat the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank:\n",
       "“I am against Brexit. I think it will be horrible for the economy. But I will go down with the ship. This is where I feel at home and I would be devastated if I had to leave”.\n",
       "Estimated immigration has fallen more steadily and significantly, down from 500,000 a year to a pre-pandemic 366,000.\n",
       "Again, the official stats are quite ropey, and the specific numbers are probably wrong. But even allowing a massive margin for error, it seems that more EU citizens came to the UK than left, despite Brexit undoubtedly leaving a sour taste for some.\n",
       "“Overall”, says McNeil “the UK’s EU migrant population has continued to grow (though much more slowly), rather than to decrease”.\n",
       "The combined effect of slightly higher emigration and lower immigration still adds up to a significant slowdown. Putting it all down to a direct Brexit effect is trickier, though: there were other things calling migrants home between 2016 and 2020.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "“Factors such as the fall in the value of the pound relative to the Euro and the Zloty following the referendum; the increasing economic opportunities in various EU member states, including Poland; and concerns about long term opportunities in the UK after Brexit are all potentially factors that may have affected people’s choices”, McNeil tellsThe Journal.\n",
       "“There is no particular evidence that post-Brexit administrative factors had a significant role to play, and little to suggest that stigmatisation of foreign workers was a major driver of emigration or of the fall in immigration”.\n",
       "The British authorities have even less idea of what’s happened since free movement ended. The Office for National Statisticssays: “There has been speculation that during 2020 and 2021 there was an exodus of people – particularly EU citizens – leaving the UK to go and live elsewhere. Did this actually happen? Simply put, we don’t know yet”.\n",
       "That’s because the pandemic has playedmerry hellwith the already unreliable records on migration and the foreign population, including an airport survey that had run continuously since 1961 but fell victim to Covid.\n",
       "Professor Alan Manning of the London School of Economics says that “although estimates that the number of migrants in the UK fell by 1.3m have now been largely discredited, some European workers have returned home”. On the other side of the balance sheet,very fewhave been applying for work visas under the new immigration system.\n",
       "The latest employment figuresrecorded 200,000fewer EU workers in the UK than pre-pandemic, while the ONS hastentatively recordedan overall population fall of 110,000 in 2020.\n",
       "But because the end of free movement coincided with the pandemic, the Migration Observatory’s Madeleine Sumption insists that “it is still too early to assess the impacts what the impacts of the new immigration system have been”.\n",
       "If EU migration to the UK is a bit hazy, the picture for British migration to and from the EU is a positive pea-souper fog.\n",
       "“We just don’t know that at the moment”, laments Professor Michaela Benson of Lancaster University, an expert on British emigrants. “At the moment, when we’re doing research, we’re using statistics that are out of date by five or six years”.\n",
       "According to the European Parliament, EU records showed “about 857 000 UK citizens in the EU at the beginning of 2019; however, the actual number is estimated to be much higher, with some pointing to 1.2 million UK nationals in the EU”.\n",
       "The 1.2 million figure comes from the United Nations. The British ONS doesn’t like the way that’s calculated, and have come up with amethod of their own. Benson’s “Brexit Brits Abroad” project has said that, on a wider definition of who is a migrant, it could be as high as3.6 million.\n",
       "Disagreement on the number of British citizens living in the EU at any one time means that it’s next to impossible to get a sense of how migration patterns have changed due to Brexit.\n",
       "A good chunk of the British emigrant population lives in Ireland – over 100,000, Benson says. “The only migrant group, of any nationality, that exceeded the British in Ireland was Polish”.\n",
       "Thanks to the Common Travel Area, that cohort has been largely spared the Brexit worries of their counterparts in France and Spain.\n",
       "British residents of mainland European countries have been able to get residence permits, although the system varies from country to country. In some, including Spain, Germany and Italy, residence rights are rolled over automatically (terms and conditions apply).\n",
       "In France and a dozen other countries, people have to apply for the right to stay, like their compatriots in the UK. All have deadlines that have either already passed or will by the end of 2021.\n",
       "But the end of free movement means that even existing residents won’t have the pre-Brexit right to hop from country to country within the EU. British nationals will need to get visas in future: what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\n",
       "Not everyone seems prepared for that reality. Piper recounts “a conversation with a Brit who is wanting to move to Greece to do the whole ‘new life in a new country thing’. I asked if they’d checked what immigration and other rules they needed to satisfy. They were astonished”.\n",
       "“The fact that Britain has left the European Union is not going to stop people moving”, Benson says. “It’s just going to change the conditions under which people move and that, in turn, will change the shape of those migrations”. How exactly remains to be seen.\n",

| the value of goods exported from ireland rose to its highest level ever last year, powered by medical and pharmaceutical products and as cross-border trade surged. figures released by the central statistics office (cso) today show €165 billion worth of goods were exported from ireland last year. this is the highest total on record and an increase of €3 billion (2%) over 2020. medical and pharmaceutical products continued to dominate ireland’s trade, accounting for 38% of all exports to the tune of €62 billion. the most eye-catching increases were seen in goods travelling to and from northern ireland. imports from the north rose by 65% to €3.9 billion while exports rose by 54% to €3.7 billion. the statistics arefurther evidenceof brexit fuelling a boom in goods travelling in both directions across the border. meanwhile, the amount of goods arriving from britain fell by 13% to €15.4 billion. exports to britain – which make up 9% of ireland’s exports – did not suffer the same fate, instead rising by 17% to €14.4 billion. advertisement due to the northern ireland protocol of the brexit agreement, trade with britain is subject to customs checks. however, the protocol effectively means northern ireland remains within the european union single market for the movement of goods while also being part of the uk customs territory. the total share of exports (left) and imports (right) by region.csocso exports to eu countries – which account for 37% of irish exports – fell by 4% to €61.5 billion. ireland still exports far more to the eu than it ships in as eu imports rose by 13% last year to €24.3 billion. this accounts for 33% of all imports. exports to non-eu countries were valued at €103.8 billion, an increase of €5.8 billion (6%). the usa was the largest export destination, accounting for €52 billion (32%) of total exports. imports also jumped compared with 2020, growing by 18% to €102 billion. it is the first time imports have exceeded the €100 billion milestone for the year. the amount of mineral fuels – such as petrol, gas and coal – being brought into ireland increased by 82% last year, to €6.1 billion, as the economy reopened. imports from non-eu countries totalled €68 billion in 2021, an increase of €11 billion (20%) on 2020. readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting

       "| https://www.thejournal.ie/uk-bill-visa-non-eu-citizens-northern-ireland-border-5625136-Dec2021/         | TÁNAISTE LEO VARADKAR has said he will raise concerns with the UK government over proposed post-Brexit arrangements to cross the Irish border.\n",
       "Under the Nationality and Borders Bill any non-Irish or non-UK citizens would need to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to enter the UK, including Northern Ireland.\n",
       "The bill is currently going through the House of Commons.\n",
       "Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty raised the matter with Varadkar in the Dáil today, saying it was a “disgrace”, claiming it threatened livelihoods and the tourism sector in the north-west and placed stress on residents.\n",
       "“It undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area and Ireland once again faces the prospect of the collateral damage of a Tory government in Westminster that doesn’t give a damn about Ireland and it’s so divorced from the reality of life on the border that it could even countenance such a measure like this,” he said.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "He pressed Varadkar to “make it absolutely clear to the British government that this is not on”.\n",
       "The Tánaiste said the Irish government would communicate its concerns and objections to the measure to the UK.\n",
       "“Unfortunately, it doesn’t come as a huge surprise,” he said.\n",
       "“If you recall, part of the argument in favour of Brexit was about controlling their borders, and also about reducing and stopping immigration from the European Union, and this is part of the outworking of that.\n",
       "“It may be the case that some people who voted for Brexit didn’t realise that but it is part of the outworking of Brexit that the United Kingdom is going to harden its borders and is going to reduce immigration, including from the European Union.\n",
       "“Ending free movement was a big part of the argument that they made. But we will absolutely be making our views known.”\n",

                                              | 2021-12-09 | NA | tánaiste leo varadkar has said he will raise concerns with the uk government over proposed post-brexit arrangements to cross the irish border. under the nationality and borders bill any non-irish or non-uk citizens would need to apply for an electronic travel authorisation (eta) to enter the uk, including northern ireland. the bill is currently going through the house of commons. sinn féin td pearse doherty raised the matter with varadkar in the dáil today, saying it was a “disgrace”, claiming it threatened livelihoods and the tourism sector in the north-west and placed stress on residents. “it undermines the good friday agreement and the common travel area and ireland once again faces the prospect of the collateral damage of a tory government in westminster that doesn’t give a damn about ireland and it’s so divorced from the reality of life on the border that it could even countenance such a measure like this,” he said. advertisement he pressed varadkar to “make it absolutely clear to the british government that this is not on”. the tánaiste said the irish government would communicate its concerns and objections to the measure to the uk. “unfortunately, it doesn’t come as a huge surprise,” he said. “if you recall, part of the argument in favour of brexit was about controlling their borders, and also about reducing and stopping immigration from the european union, and this is part of the outworking of that. “it may be the case that some people who voted for brexit didn’t realise that but it is part of the outworking of brexit that the united kingdom is going to harden its borders and is going to reduce immigration, including from the european union. “ending free movement was a big part of the argument that they made. but we will absolutely be making our views known.” readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting contributions

       "Any extension would lead to more uncertainty and was not a “solution”, according to Kevin Foster, despite calls from campaigners to push back the date amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
       "EU citizens and their families have been asked to apply to the Home Office scheme by 30 June, in order to continue living and working in the UK now the Brexit transition period and freedom of movement has ended.\n",
       "Speaking to reporters a week before the cut-off for applications, Foster said: “The EUSS has been open publicly since March 2019. We believe this has given people plenty of time to apply.\n",
       "“The sheer fact there have been over 5.6 million applications by the end of last month is testament to this.\n",
       "“I want to be clear – we will not be extending the deadline. Put simply, extending the deadline is not a solution in itself to reaching those people who have not yet applied and we would just be in a position further down the line where we would be asked to extend again, creating even more uncertainty.”\n",
       "His comments came after Downing Street said it was trying to identify tens of thousands of Europeans living in the UK who are yet to apply for the post-Brexit residency scheme.\n",
       "This followed concerns that many EU citizens – as well as nationals of Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – could have their benefits cut off if they miss the deadline.\n",
       "Number 10 insisted only a “small minority” are yet to come forward but initial official estimates on the number of anticipated applications have already been exceeded.\n",
       "Ultimately it is not known how many people who are eligible to apply are living in the UK, or how many could remain in the country undocumented.\n",
       "Advertisement\n",
       "Around 400,000 applications are still waiting to be processed and the Home Office is receiving between 10,000 and 12,000 applications a day.\n",
       "Foster said he was “concerned” over claims that outstanding cases were facing a legal limbo or facing a cliff edge – dismissing them as “just untrue”.\n",
       "The UK Government has pledged that anyone who applies by the deadline will have their existing rights protected, subject to the decision and any appeal.\n",
       "Those who have made a valid submission will have access to a certificate of application while they await their decision, Foster said.\n",
       "It typically takes around five working days for complete applications to be processed, but it can take longer than a month if more information is needed.\n",
       "The Home Office has not committed to completing all applications by 30 June and is allowing people to make a late application if they meet “reasonable grounds” for missing the deadline.\n",
       "These include:\n",
       "Late applications can take place years afterwards. For example, if a child discovered later in life that they are undocumented.\n",
       "Addressing claims EU citizens could be removed or have their benefits taken away on 1 1 July, Foster said: “We are taking a proportionate and pragmatic approach” and insisted no action would be taken against anyone who has an outstanding application.\n",
       "He revealed immigration enforcement officers will be given powers to issue a 28-day notice to anyone they discover who may be eligible for the scheme but cannot prove their immigration status. This will tell them to take urgent action to establish their lawful status by applying to the scheme.\n",
       "These may be handed out, for example, to workers discovered during immigrations raids on businesses.\n",
       "Questions still remain over whether those whose applications are rejected, or fail to apply despite requests to do so, would then face removal from the country or be asked to leave voluntarily.\n",

extending the deadline for the eu settlement scheme, an immigration minister has said. any extension would lead to more uncertainty and was not a “solution”, according to kevin foster, despite calls from campaigners to push back the date amid the coronavirus pandemic. eu citizens and their families have been asked to apply to the home office scheme by 30 june, in order to continue living and working in the uk now the brexit transition period and freedom of movement has ended. speaking to reporters a week before the cut-off for applications, foster said: “the euss has been open publicly since march 2019. we believe this has given people plenty of time to apply. “the sheer fact there have been over 5.6 million applications by the end of last month is testament to this. “i want to be clear – we will not be extending the deadline. put simply, extending the deadline is not a solution in itself to reaching those people who have not yet applied and we would just be in a position further down the line where we would be asked to extend again, creating even more uncertainty.” his comments came after downing street said it was trying to identify tens of thousands of europeans living in the uk who are yet to apply for the post-brexit residency scheme. this followed concerns that many eu citizens – as well as nationals of iceland, lichtenstein, norway and switzerland – could have their benefits cut off if they miss the deadline. number 10 insisted only a “small minority” are yet to come forward but initial official estimates on the number of anticipated applications have already been exceeded. ultimately it is not known how many people who are eligible to apply are living in the uk, or how many could remain in the country undocumented. advertisement around 400,000 applications are still waiting to be processed and the home office is receiving between 10,000 and 12,000 applications a day. foster said he was “concerned” over claims that outstanding cases were facing a legal limbo or facing a cliff edge – dismissing them as “just untrue”. the uk government has pledged that anyone who applies by the deadline will have their existing rights protected, subject to the decision and any appeal. those who have made a valid submission will have access to a certificate of application while they await their decision, foster said. it typically takes around five working days for complete applications to be processed, but it can take longer than a month if more information is needed. the home office has not committed to completing all applications by 30 june and is allowing people to make a late application if they meet “reasonable grounds” for missing the deadline. these include: late applications can take place years afterwards. for example, if a child discovered later in life that they are undocumented. addressing claims eu citizens could be removed or have their benefits taken away on 1 1 july, foster said: “we are taking a proportionate and pragmatic approach” and insisted no action would be taken against anyone who has an outstanding application. he revealed immigration enforcement officers will be given powers to issue a 28-day notice to anyone they discover who may be eligible for the scheme but cannot prove their immigration status. this will tell them to take urgent action to establish their lawful status by applying to the scheme. these may be handed out, for example, to workers discovered during immigrations raids on businesses. questions still remain over whether those whose applications are rejected, or fail to apply despite requests to do so, would then face removal from the country or be asked to leave voluntarily. readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting

       "1 THE GOVERNMENT IS to seek an “early warning system” on the use of Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol on Brexit.\\nLondon, Belfast and Dublin were blindsided by a recent attempt by the European Commission to invoke Article 16, in a row over the supply of vaccines to Europe.\\nThe Article overrides part of the Northern Ireland Protocol which prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, and was intended as an emergency measure not to be used.\\nThe European Commission backtracked on the decision, but it has caused massive political fallout, particularly in the North.\\nEuropean Affairs Minister Thomas Byrne said the Government is seeking a new safety clause, to prevent a repeat of those events.\\nHe told the Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs: “The reaction of Government that day was complete shock and surprise, and with no knowledge of what was being planned.\\n“We had spent the previous few weeks being asked about Article 16 from another perspective, and quite rightly pointing out that this was a pretty standard safeguarding clause in the trade agreement.\\n“And not designed to either eliminate the protocol or not designed to be used, except in the most extreme circumstances.”\\nHe said the Government is continuing to engage on multiple levels with the European Commission and the UK Government to find a resolution.\\nByrne added: “What the Government wants fundamentally is an early warning system to be put in place.\\n“There is a view, and it’s a risky view, that, yes, the Commission made a mistake, yes the Commission acknowledged its mistake, and that is everything solved now.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Clearly that’s not the case because the consequences of this are continuing.”\\nFine Gael TD Neale Richmond questioned if the damage caused by the incident was fully appreciated by the EU.\\nHe said: “I think the damage has been lasting. I think what we saw in the days after was that people leapt at the opportunity where a mistake was made.\\n“Are the British government now in danger of pushing this too far? We see extra demands, we see a consistent underlining that they are now preparing to trigger Article 16.\\n“We look at the, albeit typical British newspapers, and they’re demanding a renegotiation less than six weeks after the trade deal was agreed.\\n“I’m very worried that less than six weeks in, people are really damaging the house of cards.”\\nBut Byrne said that despite the damage caused, Article 16 will not be removed from the protocol.\\nHe said: “Even the Article 16 invocation, or attempted invocation, a couple of weeks ago didn’t eliminate the protocol.\\n“The protocol is still there to avoid a hard border on the island, to make sure people and goods can move freely and that Northern Ireland remains part of the single market of the European Union.”\\nIrish officials are meeting with senior figures in the European Commission on Tuesday to discuss mechanisms to avoid a repeat of the Article 16 affair.\\nByrne said he would not describe the engagement as a “key crunch meeting”.\\nHe added: “There will be ongoing engagements. We may not have resolution on this today, but I think safe to say at the moment, people are fully aware the significance of what has transpired.”\\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for

       "2 LAST UPDATE|16 Feb 2023\\nBRITISH PRIME MINISTER Rishi Sunak has travelled to the North ahead of talks with Stormont politicians amid growing speculation that a deal between the UK and EU over the controversial post-Brexit Protocol is imminent.\\nThe Tory leader is joined by Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris ahead of talks with political parties in the region over the Northern Ireland Protocol.\\nSunak will hold talks with Stormont parties and other stakeholders tomorrow.\\nHe last visited Northern Ireland in December and his latest visit will be seen as a signal that a deal over the trading arrangements for the region could be unveiled within days.\\nA spokeswoman for Sunak said: “Whilst talks with the EU are ongoing, ministers continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure any solution fixes the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.\\n“The Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland are travelling to Northern Ireland this evening to speak to political parties as part of this engagement process.”\\nHowever, a senior DUP figure has warned that a failure to end the imposition of EU law in Northern Ireland in any new UK/EU deal on post-Brexit trade will ensure Stormont’s power-sharing impasse continues.\\nNigel Dodds insisted his party would maintain its block on devolution if an agreement falls short of the measures contained within the UK Government’s own stalled draft legislation to unilaterally rip up the contentious Northern Ireland Protocol.\\nThe Northern Ireland Protocol Bill includes provisions that would remove the oversight of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the region.\\nWhile it is understood the EU and UK are close to signing off a deal that would reduce Protocol red tape on the movement of goods from Britain to Northern Ireland, there is no expectation that Brussels is willing to agree to ending the application of EU law in the region.\\nThe EU contends a fundamental plank of the Protocol – namely that Northern Ireland traders can sell freely into the European single market – is dependent on the operation of EU rules in region.\\nSpeculation is intensifying that a deal could be unveiled imminently, potentially early next week.\\nAdvertisement\\nFollowing his visit to Northern Ireland, Sunak is set to join European leaders in Germany this weekend for the Munich Security Conference and the protocol is likely to feature in discussions on the margins.\\nDodds, a former deputy leader of the DUP who now leads the party in the UK’s House of Lords, said the continued application of EU law in Northern Ireland would not be acceptable to his party.\\nHis comments, and similar remarks from other senior colleagues, suggest a new deal between the EU and UK may not ultimately be enough to convince the DUP to return to power-sharing at Stormont.\\nThe DUP is currently blocking the functioning of the devolved institutions in Belfast in protest at the protocol.\\nIn 2021, the DUP set out seven tests by which it will judge changes to the protocol. Those tests did not include a specific reference to ECJ oversight.\\nNationalist MP Claire Hanna from the SDLP said removal of single market access would have serious ramifications in Northern Ireland, particularly in relation to the agri-food sector that involves so much cross border movement of goods on the island of Ireland.\\nShe said it looked like an EU/UK deal on the protocol was “imminent”.\\n“I think we’ve all heard the rumours that the deal has been done and sitting there and I think it’s positive, it’s less friction and maintaining of dual market access, so I think that’s a win for this region,” she said.\\nHanna told BBC Radio Ulster that the DUP should be challenged to explain what the consequences would be if EU law was removed in Northern Ireland.\\n“What they mean, and they should be forced to spell it out, what they mean is they don’t want us to have access to the single market and not only is that something that is completely rejected by a substantial number of parties and the majority of our MLAs, it means no dual market access that even the DUP lauded at the inception of the protocol, and it means no integrated economy,” she said.\\n“It essentially means no agri-food economy, it means massive disruption to dairy (industry) and many of those other issues.”\\nShe added: “I think there are people in the DUP who know they are on a hiding to nothing if they keep going further down this dark alley.\\n“We know this is hard, compromise is hard, none of the options are particularly brilliant, but just saying ‘no’ is no longer an option.”

       "3 IT’S NOW OVER five years since the UK voted to leave the European Union, a result partly driven by concerns over immigration. So what’s happened with migration since then?\\nThe honest answer is that we don’t know with any certainty, especially not since the pandemic struck. The number of British citizens in the EU is contested, while the UK’s Office for National Statisticsadmits“we can’t simply count people in and out at the border”.\\nEU free movement laws allow citizens of each member country to move visa-free for work and study. There are some restrictions – the Irish authorities invoke them to remove a few dozen EU citizens from the country every year -  but it’s much, much easier than normal immigration procedures.\\nBrexit heralded the end of free movement between the UK and the EU. Or rather, most of the EU: free movement between Ireland and the UK continues under the Common Travel Area.\\nUnlike the EU version, free movement in these islands isn’t guaranteed by a binding treaty: it’s a more organic, informal arrangement. But while some expertsworrythat the Common Travel Area isn’t neat and tidy, it’s seen EU-UK free movement come and go, and means that visa-free migration continues for Irish citizens moving to Britain and vice versa.\\nAlthough the vote for Brexit (andagainst immigration) took place on 23 June 2016, the door didn’t actually slam shut until 31 December 2020. Until then, free movement continued as before despite the referendum while withdrawal negotiations dragged on and then under a transition period.\\nThe very fact of the vote was initially and anecdotally credited with sparking a “Brexodus” of Europeans from Britain, and persuading others not to come in the first place.\\n“Within our own membership many people left the UK and returned to the EU”, says Luke Piper of EU citizens’ campaign group The3Million. “The UK’s decision to leave did make many people feel unwelcome”.\\nResearchers have found plenty of people reconsidering their place in Brexit Britain. In onerecent surveyof 2,400 people, 59% said that it “increased the likelihood of them leaving the UK”.\\nHowever among an overall EU population numbering in the millions, “we have not seen a great ‘Brexodus’”, says Rob McNeil, deputy director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. “Most EU citizens in the UK are settled, have jobs and lives in the UK, and have remained, despite the political changes”.\\nWhile British migration data isnotoriously unreliable, the best estimates available show a modest increase in emigration since the referendum. In the year to March 2016, just before the referendum, anestimated220,000 EU citizens departed. That rose to 250,000 in the year to March 2020.\\nMeanwhile,over 5 millionhave now been granted permission to stay under the EU Settlement Scheme. Not all still live in the UK – some will be hedging their bets – but the overwhelming majority of existing residents were able to stay if they wanted to and knew about the scheme.\\nAs one European residenttold researchersat the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank:\\n“I am against Brexit. I think it will be horrible for the economy. But I will go down with the ship. This is where I feel at home and I would be devastated if I had to leave”.\\nEstimated immigration has fallen more steadily and significantly, down from 500,000 a year to a pre-pandemic 366,000.\\nAgain, the official stats are quite ropey, and the specific numbers are probably wrong. But even allowing a massive margin for error, it seems that more EU citizens came to the UK than left, despite Brexit undoubtedly leaving a sour taste for some.\\n“Overall”, says McNeil “the UK’s EU migrant population has continued to grow (though much more slowly), rather than to decrease”.\\nThe combined effect of slightly higher emigration and lower immigration still adds up to a significant slowdown. Putting it all down to a direct Brexit effect is trickier, though: there were other things calling migrants home between 2016 and 2020.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Factors such as the fall in the value of the pound relative to the Euro and the Zloty following the referendum; the increasing economic opportunities in various EU member states, including Poland; and concerns about long term opportunities in the UK after Brexit are all potentially factors that may have affected people’s choices”, McNeil tellsThe Journal.\\n“There is no particular evidence that post-Brexit administrative factors had a significant role to play, and little to suggest that stigmatisation of foreign workers was a major driver of emigration or of the fall in immigration”.\\nThe British authorities have even less idea of what’s happened since free movement ended. The Office for National Statisticssays: “There has been speculation that during 2020 and 2021 there was an exodus of people – particularly EU citizens – leaving the UK to go and live elsewhere. Did this actually happen? Simply put, we don’t know yet”.\\nThat’s because the pandemic has playedmerry hellwith the already unreliable records on migration and the foreign population, including an airport survey that had run continuously since 1961 but fell victim to Covid.\\nProfessor Alan Manning of the London School of Economics says that “although estimates that the number of migrants in the UK fell by 1.3m have now been largely discredited, some European workers have returned home”. On the other side of the balance sheet,very fewhave been applying for work visas under the new immigration system.\\nThe latest employment figuresrecorded 200,000fewer EU workers in the UK than pre-pandemic, while the ONS hastentatively recordedan overall population fall of 110,000 in 2020.\\nBut because the end of free movement coincided with the pandemic, the Migration Observatory’s Madeleine Sumption insists that “it is still too early to assess the impacts what the impacts of the new immigration system have been”.\\nIf EU migration to the UK is a bit hazy, the picture for British migration to and from the EU is a positive pea-souper fog.\\n“We just don’t know that at the moment”, laments Professor Michaela Benson of Lancaster University, an expert on British emigrants. “At the moment, when we’re doing research, we’re using statistics that are out of date by five or six years”.\\nAccording to the European Parliament, EU records showed “about 857 000 UK citizens in the EU at the beginning of 2019; however, the actual number is estimated to be much higher, with some pointing to 1.2 million UK nationals in the EU”.\\nThe 1.2 million figure comes from the United Nations. The British ONS doesn’t like the way that’s calculated, and have come up with amethod of their own. Benson’s “Brexit Brits Abroad” project has said that, on a wider definition of who is a migrant, it could be as high as3.6 million.\\nDisagreement on the number of British citizens living in the EU at any one time means that it’s next to impossible to get a sense of how migration patterns have changed due to Brexit.\\nA good chunk of the British emigrant population lives in Ireland – over 100,000, Benson says. “The only migrant group, of any nationality, that exceeded the British in Ireland was Polish”.\\nThanks to the Common Travel Area, that cohort has been largely spared the Brexit worries of their counterparts in France and Spain.\\nBritish residents of mainland European countries have been able to get residence permits, although the system varies from country to country. In some, including Spain, Germany and Italy, residence rights are rolled over automatically (terms and conditions apply).\\nIn France and a dozen other countries, people have to apply for the right to stay, like their compatriots in the UK. All have deadlines that have either already passed or will by the end of 2021.\\nBut the end of free movement means that even existing residents won’t have the pre-Brexit right to hop from country to country within the EU. British nationals will need to get visas in future: what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.\\nNot everyone seems prepared for that reality. Piper recounts “a conversation with a Brit who is wanting to move to Greece to do the whole ‘new life in a new country thing’. I asked if they’d checked what immigration and other rules they needed to satisfy. They were astonished”.\\n“The fact that Britain has left the European Union is not going to stop people moving”, Benson says. “It’s just going to change the conditions under which people move and that, in turn, will change the shape of those migrations”.

       "4 THE VALUE OF goods exported from Ireland rose to its highest level ever last year, powered by medical and pharmaceutical products and as cross-border trade surged.\\nFigures released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) today show €165 billion worth of goods were exported from Ireland last year. This is the highest total on record and an increase of €3 billion (2%) over 2020.\\nMedical and pharmaceutical products continued to dominate Ireland’s trade, accounting for 38% of all exports to the tune of €62 billion.\\nThe most eye-catching increases were seen in goods travelling to and from Northern Ireland. Imports from the North rose by 65% to €3.9 billion while exports rose by 54% to €3.7 billion.\\nThe statistics arefurther evidenceof Brexit fuelling a boom in goods travelling in both directions across the border.\\nMeanwhile, the amount of goods arriving from Britain fell by 13% to €15.4 billion. Exports to Britain – which make up 9% of Ireland’s exports – did not suffer the same fate, instead rising by 17% to €14.4 billion.\\nAdvertisement\\nDue to the Northern Ireland Protocol of the Brexit agreement, trade with Britain is subject to customs checks.\\nHowever, the protocol effectively means Northern Ireland remains within the European Union single market for the movement of goods while also being part of the UK customs territory.\\nThe total share of exports (left) and imports (right) by region.CSOCSO\\nExports to EU countries – which account for 37% of Irish exports – fell by 4% to €61.5 billion. Ireland still exports far more to the EU than it ships in as EU imports rose by 13% last year to €24.3 billion. This accounts for 33% of all imports.\\nExports to non-EU countries were valued at €103.8 billion, an increase of €5.8 billion (6%). The USA was the largest export destination, accounting for €52 billion (32%) of total exports.\\nImports also jumped compared with 2020, growing by 18% to €102 billion. It is the first time imports have exceeded the €100 billion milestone for the year.\\nThe amount of mineral fuels – such as petrol, gas and coal – being brought into Ireland increased by 82% last year, to €6.1 billion, as the economy reopened.\\nImports from non-EU countries totalled €68 billion in 2021, an increase of €11 billion (20%) on 2020.\\nReaders like you are keeping these stories

       "5 TÁNAISTE LEO VARADKAR has said he will raise concerns with the UK government over proposed post-Brexit arrangements to cross the Irish border.\\nUnder the Nationality and Borders Bill any non-Irish or non-UK citizens would need to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) to enter the UK, including Northern Ireland.\\nThe bill is currently going through the House of Commons.\\nSinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty raised the matter with Varadkar in the Dáil today, saying it was a “disgrace”, claiming it threatened livelihoods and the tourism sector in the north-west and placed stress on residents.\\n“It undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area and Ireland once again faces the prospect of the collateral damage of a Tory government in Westminster that doesn’t give a damn about Ireland and it’s so divorced from the reality of life on the border that it could even countenance such a measure like this,” he said.\\nAdvertisement\\nHe pressed Varadkar to “make it absolutely clear to the British government that this is not on”.\\nThe Tánaiste said the Irish government would communicate its concerns and objections to the measure to the UK.\\n“Unfortunately, it doesn’t come as a huge surprise,” he said.\\n“If you recall, part of the argument in favour of Brexit was about controlling their borders, and also about reducing and stopping immigration from the European Union, and this is part of the outworking of that.\\n“It may be the case that some people who voted for Brexit didn’t realise that but it is part of the outworking of Brexit that the United Kingdom is going to harden its borders and is going to reduce immigration, including from the European Union.\\n“Ending free movement was a big part of the argument that they made. But we will absolutely be making our views known.”\\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...A mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from

       "6 THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT will not be extending the deadline for the EU settlement scheme, an immigration minister has said.\\nAny extension would lead to more uncertainty and was not a “solution”, according to Kevin Foster, despite calls from campaigners to push back the date amid the coronavirus pandemic.\\nEU citizens and their families have been asked to apply to the Home Office scheme by 30 June, in order to continue living and working in the UK now the Brexit transition period and freedom of movement has ended.\\nSpeaking to reporters a week before the cut-off for applications, Foster said: “The EUSS has been open publicly since March 2019. We believe this has given people plenty of time to apply.\\n“The sheer fact there have been over 5.6 million applications by the end of last month is testament to this.\\n“I want to be clear – we will not be extending the deadline. Put simply, extending the deadline is not a solution in itself to reaching those people who have not yet applied and we would just be in a position further down the line where we would be asked to extend again, creating even more uncertainty.”\\nHis comments came after Downing Street said it was trying to identify tens of thousands of Europeans living in the UK who are yet to apply for the post-Brexit residency scheme.\\nThis followed concerns that many EU citizens – as well as nationals of Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – could have their benefits cut off if they miss the deadline.\\nNumber 10 insisted only a “small minority” are yet to come forward but initial official estimates on the number of anticipated applications have already been exceeded.\\nUltimately it is not known how many people who are eligible to apply are living in the UK, or how many could remain in the country undocumented.\\nAdvertisement\\nAround 400,000 applications are still waiting to be processed and the Home Office is receiving between 10,000 and 12,000 applications a day.\\nFoster said he was “concerned” over claims that outstanding cases were facing a legal limbo or facing a cliff edge – dismissing them as “just untrue”.\\nThe UK Government has pledged that anyone who applies by the deadline will have their existing rights protected, subject to the decision and any appeal.\\nThose who have made a valid submission will have access to a certificate of application while they await their decision, Foster said.\\nIt typically takes around five working days for complete applications to be processed, but it can take longer than a month if more information is needed.\\nThe Home Office has not committed to completing all applications by 30 June and is allowing people to make a late application if they meet “reasonable grounds” for missing the deadline.\\nThese include:\\nLate applications can take place years afterwards. For example, if a child discovered later in life that they are undocumented.\\nAddressing claims EU citizens could be removed or have their benefits taken away on 1 1 July, Foster said: “We are taking a proportionate and pragmatic approach” and insisted no action would be taken against anyone who has an outstanding application.\\nHe revealed immigration enforcement officers will be given powers to issue a 28-day notice to anyone they discover who may be eligible for the scheme but cannot prove their immigration status. This will tell them to take urgent action to establish their lawful status by applying to the scheme.\\nThese may be handed out, for example, to workers discovered during immigrations raids on businesses.\\nQuestions still remain over whether those whose applications are rejected, or fail to apply despite requests to do so, would then face removal from the country or be asked to leave voluntarily.\\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...A mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this

       "1 the government is to seek an “early warning system” on the use of article 16 of the northern ireland protocol on brexit. london, belfast and dublin were blindsided by a recent attempt by the european commission to invoke article 16, in a row over the supply of vaccines to europe. the article overrides part of the northern ireland protocol which prevents a hard border on the island of ireland, and was intended as an emergency measure not to be used. the european commission backtracked on the decision, but it has caused massive political fallout, particularly in the north. european affairs minister thomas byrne said the government is seeking a new safety clause, to prevent a repeat of those events. he told the oireachtas committee on european union affairs: “the reaction of government that day was complete shock and surprise, and with no knowledge of what was being planned. “we had spent the previous few weeks being asked about article 16 from another perspective, and quite rightly pointing out that this was a pretty standard safeguarding clause in the trade agreement. “and not designed to either eliminate the protocol or not designed to be used, except in the most extreme circumstances.” he said the government is continuing to engage on multiple levels with the european commission and the uk government to find a resolution. byrne added: “what the government wants fundamentally is an early warning system to be put in place. “there is a view, and it’s a risky view, that, yes, the commission made a mistake, yes the commission acknowledged its mistake, and that is everything solved now. advertisement “clearly that’s not the case because the consequences of this are continuing.” fine gael td neale richmond questioned if the damage caused by the incident was fully appreciated by the eu. he said: “i think the damage has been lasting. i think what we saw in the days after was that people leapt at the opportunity where a mistake was made. “are the british government now in danger of pushing this too far? we see extra demands, we see a consistent underlining that they are now preparing to trigger article 16. “we look at the, albeit typical british newspapers, and they’re demanding a renegotiation less than six weeks after the trade deal was agreed. “i’m very worried that less than six weeks in, people are really damaging the house of cards.” but byrne said that despite the damage caused, article 16 will not be removed from the protocol. he said: “even the article 16 invocation, or attempted invocation, a couple of weeks ago didn’t eliminate the protocol. “the protocol is still there to avoid a hard border on the island, to make sure people and goods can move freely and that northern ireland remains part of the single market of the european union.” irish officials are meeting with senior figures in the european commission on tuesday to discuss mechanisms to avoid a repeat of the article 16 affair. byrne said he would not describe the engagement as a “key crunch meeting”. he added: “there will be ongoing engagements. we may not have resolution on this today, but i think safe to say at the moment, people are fully aware the significance of what has transpired.” readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable

       "2 british prime minister rishi sunak has travelled to the north ahead of talks with stormont politicians amid growing speculation that a deal between the uk and eu over the controversial post-brexit protocol is imminent. the tory leader is joined by northern ireland secretary chris heaton-harris ahead of talks with political parties in the region over the northern ireland protocol. sunak will hold talks with stormont parties and other stakeholders tomorrow. he last visited northern ireland in december and his latest visit will be seen as a signal that a deal over the trading arrangements for the region could be unveiled within days. a spokeswoman for sunak said: “whilst talks with the eu are ongoing, ministers continue to engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure any solution fixes the practical problems on the ground, meets our overarching objectives, and safeguards northern ireland’s place in the uk’s internal market. “the prime minister and secretary of state for northern ireland are travelling to northern ireland this evening to speak to political parties as part of this engagement process.” however, a senior dup figure has warned that a failure to end the imposition of eu law in northern ireland in any new uk/eu deal on post-brexit trade will ensure stormont’s power-sharing impasse continues. nigel dodds insisted his party would maintain its block on devolution if an agreement falls short of the measures contained within the uk government’s own stalled draft legislation to unilaterally rip up the contentious northern ireland protocol. the northern ireland protocol bill includes provisions that would remove the oversight of the european court of justice (ecj) in the region. while it is understood the eu and uk are close to signing off a deal that would reduce protocol red tape on the movement of goods from britain to northern ireland, there is no expectation that brussels is willing to agree to ending the application of eu law in the region. the eu contends a fundamental plank of the protocol – namely that northern ireland traders can sell freely into the european single market – is dependent on the operation of eu rules in region. speculation is intensifying that a deal could be unveiled imminently, potentially early next week. advertisement following his visit to northern ireland, sunak is set to join european leaders in germany this weekend for the munich security conference and the protocol is likely to feature in discussions on the margins. dodds, a former deputy leader of the dup who now leads the party in the uk’s house of lords, said the continued application of eu law in northern ireland would not be acceptable to his party. his comments, and similar remarks from other senior colleagues, suggest a new deal between the eu and uk may not ultimately be enough to convince the dup to return to power-sharing at stormont. the dup is currently blocking the functioning of the devolved institutions in belfast in protest at the protocol. in 2021, the dup set out seven tests by which it will judge changes to the protocol. those tests did not include a specific reference to ecj oversight. nationalist mp claire hanna from the sdlp said removal of single market access would have serious ramifications in northern ireland, particularly in relation to the agri-food sector that involves so much cross border movement of goods on the island of ireland. she said it looked like an eu/uk deal on the protocol was “imminent”. “i think we’ve all heard the rumours that the deal has been done and sitting there and i think it’s positive, it’s less friction and maintaining of dual market access, so i think that’s a win for this region,” she said. hanna told bbc radio ulster that the dup should be challenged to explain what the consequences would be if eu law was removed in northern ireland. “what they mean, and they should be forced to spell it out, what they mean is they don’t want us to have access to the single market and not only is that something that is completely rejected by a substantial number of parties and the majority of our mlas, it means no dual market access that even the dup lauded at the inception of the protocol, and it means no integrated economy,” she said. “it essentially means no agri-food economy, it means massive disruption to dairy (industry) and many of those other issues.” she added: “i think there are people in the dup who know they are on a hiding to nothing if they keep going further down this dark alley. “we know this is hard, compromise is hard, none of the options are particularly brilliant, but just saying ‘no’ is no longer an option.”

       "3 it’s now over five years since the uk voted to leave the european union, a result partly driven by concerns over immigration. so what’s happened with migration since then? the honest answer is that we don’t know with any certainty, especially not since the pandemic struck. the number of british citizens in the eu is contested, while the uk’s office for national statisticsadmits“we can’t simply count people in and out at the border”. eu free movement laws allow citizens of each member country to move visa-free for work and study. there are some restrictions – the irish authorities invoke them to remove a few dozen eu citizens from the country every year - but it’s much, much easier than normal immigration procedures. brexit heralded the end of free movement between the uk and the eu. or rather, most of the eu: free movement between ireland and the uk continues under the common travel area. unlike the eu version, free movement in these islands isn’t guaranteed by a binding treaty: it’s a more organic, informal arrangement. but while some expertsworrythat the common travel area isn’t neat and tidy, it’s seen eu-uk free movement come and go, and means that visa-free migration continues for irish citizens moving to britain and vice versa. although the vote for brexit (andagainst immigration) took place on 23 june 2016, the door didn’t actually slam shut until 31 december 2020. until then, free movement continued as before despite the referendum while withdrawal negotiations dragged on and then under a transition period. the very fact of the vote was initially and anecdotally credited with sparking a “brexodus” of europeans from britain, and persuading others not to come in the first place. “within our own membership many people left the uk and returned to the eu”, says luke piper of eu citizens’ campaign group the3million. “the uk’s decision to leave did make many people feel unwelcome”. researchers have found plenty of people reconsidering their place in brexit britain. in onerecent surveyof 2,400 people, 59% said that it “increased the likelihood of them leaving the uk”. however among an overall eu population numbering in the millions, “we have not seen a great ‘brexodus’”, says rob mcneil, deputy director of the migration observatory at the university of oxford. “most eu citizens in the uk are settled, have jobs and lives in the uk, and have remained, despite the political changes”. while british migration data isnotoriously unreliable, the best estimates available show a modest increase in emigration since the referendum. in the year to march 2016, just before the referendum, anestimated220,000 eu citizens departed. that rose to 250,000 in the year to march 2020. meanwhile,over 5 millionhave now been granted permission to stay under the eu settlement scheme. not all still live in the uk – some will be hedging their bets – but the overwhelming majority of existing residents were able to stay if they wanted to and knew about the scheme. as one european residenttold researchersat the uk in a changing europe think-tank: “i am against brexit. i think it will be horrible for the economy. but i will go down with the ship. this is where i feel at home and i would be devastated if i had to leave”. estimated immigration has fallen more steadily and significantly, down from 500,000 a year to a pre-pandemic 366,000. again, the official stats are quite ropey, and the specific numbers are probably wrong. but even allowing a massive margin for error, it seems that more eu citizens came to the uk than left, despite brexit undoubtedly leaving a sour taste for some. “overall”, says mcneil “the uk’s eu migrant population has continued to grow (though much more slowly), rather than to decrease”. the combined effect of slightly higher emigration and lower immigration still adds up to a significant slowdown. putting it all down to a direct brexit effect is trickier, though: there were other things calling migrants home between 2016 and 2020. advertisement “factors such as the fall in the value of the pound relative to the euro and the zloty following the referendum; the increasing economic opportunities in various eu member states, including poland; and concerns about long term opportunities in the uk after brexit are all potentially factors that may have affected people’s choices”, mcneil tellsthe journal. “there is no particular evidence that post-brexit administrative factors had a significant role to play, and little to suggest that stigmatisation of foreign workers was a major driver of emigration or of the fall in immigration”. the british authorities have even less idea of what’s happened since free movement ended. the office for national statisticssays: “there has been speculation that during 2020 and 2021 there was an exodus of people – particularly eu citizens – leaving the uk to go and live elsewhere. did this actually happen? simply put, we don’t know yet”. that’s because the pandemic has playedmerry hellwith the already unreliable records on migration and the foreign population, including an airport survey that had run continuously since 1961 but fell victim to covid. professor alan manning of the london school of economics says that “although estimates that the number of migrants in the uk fell by 1.3m have now been largely discredited, some european workers have returned home”. on the other side of the balance sheet,very fewhave been applying for work visas under the new immigration system. the latest employment figuresrecorded 200,000fewer eu workers in the uk than pre-pandemic, while the ons hastentatively recordedan overall population fall of 110,000 in 2020. but because the end of free movement coincided with the pandemic, the migration observatory’s madeleine sumption insists that “it is still too early to assess the impacts what the impacts of the new immigration system have been”. if eu migration to the uk is a bit hazy, the picture for british migration to and from the eu is a positive pea-souper fog. “we just don’t know that at the moment”, laments professor michaela benson of lancaster university, an expert on british emigrants. “at the moment, when we’re doing research, we’re using statistics that are out of date by five or six years”. according to the european parliament, eu records showed “about 857 000 uk citizens in the eu at the beginning of 2019; however, the actual number is estimated to be much higher, with some pointing to 1.2 million uk nationals in the eu”. the 1.2 million figure comes from the united nations. the british ons doesn’t like the way that’s calculated, and have come up with amethod of their own. benson’s “brexit brits abroad” project has said that, on a wider definition of who is a migrant, it could be as high as3.6 million. disagreement on the number of british citizens living in the eu at any one time means that it’s next to impossible to get a sense of how migration patterns have changed due to brexit. a good chunk of the british emigrant population lives in ireland – over 100,000, benson says. “the only migrant group, of any nationality, that exceeded the british in ireland was polish”. thanks to the common travel area, that cohort has been largely spared the brexit worries of their counterparts in france and spain. british residents of mainland european countries have been able to get residence permits, although the system varies from country to country. in some, including spain, germany and italy, residence rights are rolled over automatically (terms and conditions apply). in france and a dozen other countries, people have to apply for the right to stay, like their compatriots in the uk. all have deadlines that have either already passed or will by the end of 2021. but the end of free movement means that even existing residents won’t have the pre-brexit right to hop from country to country within the eu. british nationals will need to get visas in future: what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. not everyone seems prepared for that reality. piper recounts “a conversation with a brit who is wanting to move to greece to do the whole ‘new life in a new country thing’. i asked if they’d checked what immigration and other rules they needed to satisfy. they were astonished”. “the fact that britain has left the european union is not going to stop people moving”, benson says. “it’s just going to change the conditions under which people move and that, in turn, will change the shape of those migrations”. how exactly remains to be seen. this work is co-funded by journal media and a grant programme from the european parliament. any opinions or conclusions expressed in this work is the author’s own. the european parliament has no involvement in nor responsibility for the editorial content published by the project. for more information,see here.\n",
       "4 the value of goods exported from ireland rose to its highest level ever last year, powered by medical and pharmaceutical products and as cross-border trade surged. figures released by the central statistics office (cso) today show €165 billion worth of goods were exported from ireland last year. this is the highest total on record and an increase of €3 billion (2%) over 2020. medical and pharmaceutical products continued to dominate ireland’s trade, accounting for 38% of all exports to the tune of €62 billion. the most eye-catching increases were seen in goods travelling to and from northern ireland. imports from the north rose by 65% to €3.9 billion while exports rose by 54% to €3.7 billion. the statistics arefurther evidenceof brexit fuelling a boom in goods travelling in both directions across the border. meanwhile, the amount of goods arriving from britain fell by 13% to €15.4 billion. exports to britain – which make up 9% of ireland’s exports – did not suffer the same fate, instead rising by 17% to €14.4 billion. advertisement due to the northern ireland protocol of the brexit agreement, trade with britain is subject to customs checks. however, the protocol effectively means northern ireland remains within the european union single market for the movement of goods while also being part of the uk customs territory. the total share of exports (left) and imports (right) by region.csocso exports to eu countries – which account for 37% of irish exports – fell by 4% to €61.5 billion. ireland still exports far more to the eu than it ships in as eu imports rose by 13% last year to €24.3 billion. this accounts for 33% of all imports. exports to non-eu countries were valued at €103.8 billion, an increase of €5.8 billion (6%). the usa was the largest export destination, accounting for €52 billion (32%) of total exports. imports also jumped compared with 2020, growing by 18% to €102 billion. it is the first time imports have exceeded the €100 billion milestone for the year. the amount of mineral fuels – such as petrol, gas and coal – being brought into ireland increased by 82% last year, to €6.1 billion, as the economy reopened. imports from non-eu countries totalled €68 billion in 2021, an increase of €11 billion (20%) on 2020. readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting

       "5 tánaiste leo varadkar has said he will raise concerns with the uk government over proposed post-brexit arrangements to cross the irish border. under the nationality and borders bill any non-irish or non-uk citizens would need to apply for an electronic travel authorisation (eta) to enter the uk, including northern ireland. the bill is currently going through the house of commons. sinn féin td pearse doherty raised the matter with varadkar in the dáil today, saying it was a “disgrace”, claiming it threatened livelihoods and the tourism sector in the north-west and placed stress on residents. “it undermines the good friday agreement and the common travel area and ireland once again faces the prospect of the collateral damage of a tory government in westminster that doesn’t give a damn about ireland and it’s so divorced from the reality of life on the border that it could even countenance such a measure like this,” he said. advertisement he pressed varadkar to “make it absolutely clear to the british government that this is not on”. the tánaiste said the irish government would communicate its concerns and objections to the measure to the uk. “unfortunately, it doesn’t come as a huge surprise,” he said. “if you recall, part of the argument in favour of brexit was about controlling their borders, and also about reducing and stopping immigration from the european union, and this is part of the outworking of that. “it may be the case that some people who voted for brexit didn’t realise that but it is part of the outworking of brexit that the united kingdom is going to harden its borders and is going to reduce immigration, including from the european union. “ending free movement was a big part of the argument that they made. but we will absolutely be making our views known.” readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...a mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable

       "6 the british government will not be extending the deadline for the eu settlement scheme, an immigration minister has said. any extension would lead to more uncertainty and was not a “solution”, according to kevin foster, despite calls from campaigners to push back the date amid the coronavirus pandemic. eu citizens and their families have been asked to apply to the home office scheme by 30 june, in order to continue living and working in the uk now the brexit transition period and freedom of movement has ended. speaking to reporters a week before the cut-off for applications, foster said: “the euss has been open publicly since march 2019. we believe this has given people plenty of time to apply. “the sheer fact there have been over 5.6 million applications by the end of last month is testament to this. “i want to be clear – we will not be extending the deadline. put simply, extending the deadline is not a solution in itself to reaching those people who have not yet applied and we would just be in a position further down the line where we would be asked to extend again, creating even more uncertainty.” his comments came after downing street said it was trying to identify tens of thousands of europeans living in the uk who are yet to apply for the post-brexit residency scheme. this followed concerns that many eu citizens – as well as nationals of iceland, lichtenstein, norway and switzerland – could have their benefits cut off if they miss the deadline. number 10 insisted only a “small minority” are yet to come forward but initial official estimates on the number of anticipated applications have already been exceeded. ultimately it is not known how many people who are eligible to apply are living in the uk, or how many could remain in the country undocumented. advertisement around 400,000 applications are still waiting to be processed and the home office is receiving between 10,000 and 12,000 applications a day. foster said he was “concerned” over claims that outstanding cases were facing a legal limbo or facing a cliff edge – dismissing them as “just untrue”. the uk government has pledged that anyone who applies by the deadline will have their existing rights protected, subject to the decision and any appeal. those who have made a valid submission will have access to a certificate of application while they await their decision, foster said. it typically takes around five working days for complete applications to be processed, but it can take longer than a month if more information is needed. the home office has not committed to completing all applications by 30 june and is allowing people to make a late application if they meet “reasonable grounds” for missing the deadline. these include: late applications can take place years afterwards. for example, if a child discovered later in life that they are undocumented. addressing claims eu citizens could be removed or have their benefits taken away on 1 1 july, foster said: “we are taking a proportionate and pragmatic approach” and insisted no action would be taken against anyone who has an outstanding application. he revealed immigration enforcement officers will be given powers to issue a 28-day notice to anyone they discover who may be eligible for the scheme but cannot prove their immigration status. this will tell them to take urgent action to establish their lawful status by applying to the scheme. these may be handed out, for example, to workers discovered during immigrations raids on businesses. questions still remain over whether those whose applications are rejected, or fail to apply despite requests to do so, would then face removal from the country or be asked to leave voluntarily. readers like you are keeping
