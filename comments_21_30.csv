The commission can only negotiate with the UK government as it’s interlocutor. It cannot negotiate with the British Parliament. The Benn Act requires Boris to send a letter to Commission stating the parliament has requested an extension. Parliament cannot request that the government has requested this extension as the whole cabinet voted against the Benn Act. All Boris has to do is hand in the letter and explain this is not the view of the UK government and I am not asking for this extension. This then puts the EU in a bind as they cannot deal with anyone other than Boris and the government.
The only way around this would be for the opposition parties to topple Boris and install a caretaker government who could hand in the letter. Time for this is now very short and moreover the opposition is completely divided.","Oct 7th 2019, 3:42 PM"

The BoE will then have to step in and raise interest rates which pushes up mortgage repayments which pushes up inflation even more. SME’s will come under pressure to raise wage levels to keep up with the rising inflation. Add in WTO tarriffs and all exports and imports become far more expensive, combined with hìgher wage demands, many SME’s won’t be able to cope, which will raise unemployment levels. The Social Welfare system then comes under strain as more people are added and with Price rises dole payments will also have to rise. And with less of a tax take due to companies closing or down sizeing the Government are forced to borrow even more and the deficit grows. As the Deficit grows the credit rating slips down making borrowing more expensive. All the while having to Trade on WTO terms because there are no trade deals in place and unlikely to be for 5-10 years.

Parliament’s decision not to get Brexit done by the original deadline goes against the ‘will of the people’.

2) I believe that the EU are on very shaky ground. The economic driving force of the EU, Germany, is heading towards recession. Irish troops will need to maintain a hard border in NI. The economic impact of a hard Brexit will probably lead to a recession here and in many other EU countries.

Proposals like that, by the way, are precisely why Ireland cannot afford to simply rely on ‘goodwill’ in terms of protection of the GFA – if ideas like that count as ‘reasonable’ in the current UK government’s thinking, we absolutely need legally binding agreements that sort out the issues upfront, and a status-quo fallback if agreement cannot be reached.","Aug 21st 2019, 7:44 PM"

And like all Empires they were built on slavery by using their military to enslave people and lands for profits for businesses. The British navy was built on being pirates and their army was built on slavery, spice and for sugar but now Britain is run for their banks, their “City of London” is another name for a group of banks that caused Brexit at the very beginning… http://docs.dpaq.de/10395-0216-euco-conclusions.pdf
Just search BANK in this document and it turns up 19 times. Brexit happened because the Brexit vote was believed it couldn’t happen and the vote was about the city of London banks using that vote to get the ECB to look after them. The Brexit vote was an ill thought out because those behind it never thought it could have ever happened due to their greed and arrogance.
British media is bias and they do follow their governments narrative, look at the Skripal poisonings as the hospital staff was treating them for Fentanyl poisoning for the first 3 days as the police stuck a policeman on their front door for a week before they said that it was novachok and now the head of the investigation says there’s no evidence that Russia was involved but that is kept quiet. Another is trying to make out that Assad poisoned his own people with nerve gas when the video they used to bomb Syria was CREATED by the White Helmets, even Boris meeting Macaroon (lol) restated Assad gassed his own people in the same breath as he talked about the Backstop. UK politicians only work for lobbyists and oil men, that is their foreign policies and that is why the British had an Empire and that is why the US has an Empire as well and both use their armies as rent an army to business people and this Russophobia is about stopping Russia having a slice of the pie as businesses grow fat and greedy on stealing the resources of other countries for themselves and then governments call this national security. Foreign policies for governments is about profits for rich individuals or groups who donate in one way or another to the political system normally based on money. In the UK Brexit is about greed for those who want to leave as it seems as well as for those who want to stay as well, and that proves how much they don’t know?","Aug 23rd 2019, 1:16 PM"

A Dairy farmer is probably the most important, person on the planet and receives some of the least earnings, 70% of the world depend on milk, cheese cream and other dairy products. Dairy farmers/workers have to rise out of bed early to milk their cows, and then are depending on fetching a decent price for their product, Cows need to be impregnated and get pregnant to produce milk, calves are born and reared for a period of time then sold off to a beef farmer who fattens the up for sale to meat producers.
Again depending on market prices whether or not a profit is materialized, The meat is processed and sold on, butchers etc. And as a butcher by trade, I can ask this question.
Who really makes the most money, out of it all ?. There is very little left to waste. But the hide, pelt, (skin of both beef and sheep, and other animals) can return hefty profits for some, as in shoes, coats, bags, belts, etc. Many items fetching Thousands of Euro’s dollars etc
Imagine if a Dairy farmer, Beef farmer, even the butchers, was to receive a tiny percentage, from all concerned along the way, from the beef farmer, dairy producers, butchers, tanners, to the cobbler and more. That would give some a nice extra income,
It sickens me when actors etc get paid every time they are on screen, in repeats, or sports stars doing promotions adds etc. Imagine if your electrician charged you every time you turned on your lights, TV, computer, cooker, microwave, fridge etc, Or the plumber charged for every shower, bath, every flush of the toilet, using a garden hose etc, or the carpenter when you opened or closed a door, window walked on the floor. We take all these for granted, and they the low earners.
But don’t seemly have a problem, handing over money, to go to movies theaters, pay outlandish prices for clothing or attire, for some celebrities name or image on it, I know a number of people that are happy to pay a TV subscription of over €100.00 a month, for movie, sports channels, a similar expense on phones, and yet can be behind in rent utility bills, short of food, and decent clothing.
Television has been the great influence in our lives for close on or more than 70 years. But there is very little new out there, so many repeats, some on a weekly basis, Shown on a Sunday again on a Thursday. The same actors and crew getting paid over and over again. Making some very rich indeed.
Chat show hosts, getting outrageous money for a couple of hours work, whether they are actually entertaining or not, There are enough companies paying for Add minutes between breaks, who depend on the exposure, to pay for the lot, the host crew, , tv license etc etc, the add’s interruption of shows, can actually be construed as an invasion of your privacy, of an invasion of your, enjoyment, a means to mind suggestion and mental control, if they induce you to react and purchase, or contribute. Some companies should be taken to court in a class action suit, by people who have been influenced by their manipulation of you in your own house, or where ever you are watching.
The phone networks are another example of been manipulated, with all these plans they are promoting, If one doesn’t make that many calls or sent many texts in a month, it can work out very expensive for the calls and texts that are made, they offer a Data allowance, but very often, unavailable when actually needed.

Now the Pylons supporting the Bridge would have to be driven into the sea bed to a depth of around 300 feet and add another 200 feet above the waterline to allow shipping to pass freely. So your Pylons would have to be around 1500 feet long and about 50 feet in diameter each. Each one would have to be able to take hurricane force winds and wave action without snapping like a twig during winter storms. Add to this the length of the Bridge span at 22 miles. So during storm conditions the Bridge would have to be closed to traffic for safety reasons (most winters). Now add in the further complication of all the unused unexploded ammunition and explosives dumped by the Royal Navy in the area over the past 80 years. Then you would have the cost of Maintance.

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
“This could be Heaven or this could be Hell”
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
“Please bring me my wine.”
He said, “We haven’t had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine.”
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin’ it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said “We are all just prisoners here, of our own device”
And in the master’s chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can’t kill the beast
Last thing I remember
I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
“Relax,” said the night man
“We are programmed to receive
You can check-out any time you like
But you can never leave!”","Sep 14th 2019, 12:31 AM"

However as Lenin says …nothing changes in a century and everything changes in a week…and the recent history of Europe has shown that to be true. If Armagh and Derry become a commercial Zimbabwe to Donegal and Monaghan with the destruction of their economies then the pressure will be on pretty instantly to escape the country and the delusions that caused it…and that means a rapid border poll or the risk of civil resistance…in republican areas…(boycotting British courts and Revenue etc). The quid pro quo of consent to British rule was open access to the rest of Ireland. Britain broke it so the quid quo pro is gone. The British would think it outrageous to allow Dorset to be Belarus to Somerset contrary to an international agreement by a decision overseas….yet believe it’s fine in Tyrone. They will find to their cost that it is not…and they will own the result…with no idea how to deal with it as their own supply chains go down.

Even if the UK government constantly refuses to acknowledge it, Ireland is the EU. They refused to see this back in 2016 and its because of lack of education and the DUPs stance against the backstop that they are in the mess they are in.

The UK parliament rejected the ‘deal’ three times. Much as I hate to admit it, Bojo is right on this one – that ‘deal’ is effectively dead at this stage. Until our politicians (and the EU) get that into their thick skulls we’re on a hiding to nothing.
It’s possible that the UK’s red lines and the EU’s red lines are just too far apart and a deal was never going to be possible in the first place.

Secondly even if they could pull off some attacks down south, why would they, for an independent northern Ireland? The English mostly would be glad of the 13 billion saving made and would respect a democratic vote. Most likely their would be pockets of violence in certain areas in the north but that would be it.
Personally I wouldn’t like to see a United Ireland unless it was voted in with a two thirds majority which would need a big chunk of voters that are of the unionist tradition but highly unlikely.

The position of the Irish Govt is fundamentally that of the Oireachtas. All agree that the GFA must be protected and a hard border avoided. If a hard border returns the responsibility will be that of the U.K. Not Ireland or the EU. And this is because the U.K. wants to avoid the reality of the implications of the GFA for Brexit.

A monumental economic crash will be the great leveller to bring the multiples to heel and is on the cuspe. Ireland in the last thirty years, bears no resemblance to the out stretched hand of yesteryear. Regarding yesteryear all was far from perfect? Magdaline laundries the orphanages. The assertive efforts to turn the populace into religious and conservative ideals worked with the help of successive governments. These ideals were borne mainly by two individuals, sorry three W.T. Cosgrave, Eamonn DeValera and if anything resembles an anti-christ last but not least Archbishop John Charles McQuaid. One is on its death knell “religion”. Now the last stumbling block “conservatism” must be dealt the final blow. All was not perfect indeed, but one thing that could not be easily quenched was a land where many of the workers not all understood the helping hand? Though many through the policies of successive dynastic families make your own choices eg Lenihan. Coventry and the rest. The part that is most endearing must live on and that’s called neighborhood alliance and friendship. Even though we are on the offensive here? Greed taken over from what was indeed poverty. The balance here must be addressed. Otherwise we will be be led like sheep to the slaughter. The banks and it’s machinations in government has us all by the scrotum. Unity even though it seems to cloud over many people’s judgement unity and respect of traditions is the key for now and future generations to come in all aspects of Irish life.

Boris Johnson is doing no more or no less than any other prime minister has done every year, going back centuries. And the dates he has picked for the proroguing of parliament mean that parliament will be prorogued 4 days longer than the average. 4 days !!! What is being overlooked here is the question of why remainers actually want NO proroguing this year, and want to continue on with this years session of parliament which is already the longest in 400 years. This proroguing has been spoken about all summer as if it was something out of the ordinary, despite the fact is is an annual occurance. It was framed by remainers and their media allies as a dirty word, an affront to democracy. Why didn’t remainers seek an early recall of parliament, and an early proroguing of parliament during which time they could have held early party conferences ? Because they didn’t want that.

Why this is needed when parliament has been in summer recess is another thing altogether but, given the short time left to the European summit and Brexit deadline, and the length of time it takes to get anything done in parliament, it is clearly an attempt to stifle debate and block MP’s from having time to prepare and vote on the legislation needed to prevent a no-deal exit.

In Greek mythology, the goddess Athena did assist Hercules as an ally during the performance of his 12 labours. She provided, for example, bronze krotala – noise-makers similar to castanets – to help him scare off the flock of Stymphalian birds. And in some versions of the tale she was also of service to him by returning to their rightful place the golden apples of the gods that Hercules had been asked to obtain.
But it is perhaps her most dramatic intervention in the life of Hercules that Varadkar was obliquely referring to.
Hercules was obliged to perform the 12 labours as an act of penitence after he had descended into madness and murdered his wife, Megara, and his children. At the moment he was about to go on and kill the man who had fostered him, Amphitryon, Athena intervened. Seeing that he had gone mad, she struck Hercules down and knocked him out to prevent him causing more bloodshed and doing more damage than he had already done.

What source do you have that claims Athena was the one that kept hercules from killing himself? Edith Hamilton is considered the premier authority on Greek mythology and mentions Athena nowhere in the tale of the skating of Hercules family. A character that is mentioned is Theseus. Theseus comes to Hercules as he sits covered in blood and caresses Hercules hands. This gesture tells Hercules that they now share in his guilt. This stops him from killing himself. I think the confusion with this and the article you reference on this story is that Theseus is the hero of Athena and Athena it’s goddess. I think this is what has caused the mix-up in this tale as there is no mention of Athena in this part of the story of Hercules.,"Sep 9th 2019, 8:24 PM"

While the majority voted to leave and that’s democracy,I wonder how the majority would vote now given that many of the consequences are highlighted and if genuine comprehensive information leaflets highlighting all the consequences of Brexit were issued to households so that people would be FULLY informed?It’s not just Ireland and Northern Ireland including GFA that will bear the consequences but the UK also.
How a Prime Minister that was found in Court to misleading the Queen and illegally proroguing Parliament is allowed in office to continue to Brexit crashout is beyond my comprehension!!!
He showed disrespect for Ireland by showing his plans to other European countries yesterday,.I believe that really with him in charge the previous good relationship between Ireland and UK has been damaged including worryingly potentially damaging the GFA.That is worrying.
There were warnings from NTMA chief that chances of recession in Ireland was 100% and ESRI warned of recession too if no deal Brexit.
Ireland&UK have important responsibility to uphold GFA,it’s not optional!The border must be kept open not just for both economies but also to protect the GFA.I hope that grave responsibility both Governments have re GFA isn’t sidestepped!

What’s actually interesting here is the timing of it all. Parliament re-convenes on the 3rd of September. Assuming a vote of no-confidence could be held and passed the following day then the earliest the Government could fall is the 18th. Further assuming that the minimum 6 week waiting period is followed then the earliest date for the election would be Wednesday October 30th.

https://www.thejournal.ie/coveney-brexit-barclay-barnier-brussels-4817136-Sep2019/,"Brexit is a symptom of Populism in western capitalist economies which points a finger at
external forces as being the root cause of the working class woes when in essence its the system which has seen the rich getting richer and the working class becomming poorer which is an internal ecomomic-political problem.
The GFC was caused by Wall Street & its billionaire class investors and the working class was then saddled with paying the bill and populists like Steve Bannon who were
part of the Wall Street mob led the Populist charge in blaming immigration & the lack of patriotism for a country’s economic & social woes instead to highlighting the unbridled
ravages of Western Capitalism as the core cause of working class discontent.
Then along comes Trump, Johnston etc advocating 19C Mercantalism which led to WW1. This same Merchantilism led to abject poverty among the working class and
the seeds of Communism led by Lennin.
The obvious answer is for western governments to rejig their taxation, welfare & wealth
redistribution mechanisms so the every citizen gets a fair shake of the sauce bottle rather than a few gobbling up the megaprofits and leaving the working class to foot the bill. Since 2008 Ireland is a classic example of that.
Ireland by its EU membership has little or no power in protecting itself from the impending economic ravages of Brexit so we should be insisting that the EU compensates us for what are the negative economic consequences of the EU & UK’s actions. We simply dont want another GFC scenario where working class Irish pick
up the tab for the wrong doing of others.

Attached article from the sun about boris offer to pay ireland brexit costs .
A golden opportunity for ireland to seek ammend to good friday agreemet in retr for consent to removal of backstop.
My question why was not this debated in the DAIL .
Why dd not leo varadker bring this proposal to the Dail for Dail instruction with ireland price ?
Instead L Varadker n his cycling tour in denmark said we will be happy to see UK apply for an extensions. Johnston say take deal or we are out to the EU.
Ireland is the real torn .
The Commission refused to enter into negotiation with the UK over the weekend and I suspect the message was to the UK try to come to an arrangement with Irland . The Dail closed .
If uk leaves as far as commission concerned ireland is responsible for the cost and Minister has taken 1. 5 billion euro out of the pensions fund with enabling legislation vote on by TDs.
The country is in deficit over the fiscal compact treaty threshold as a DEBTOR AND if the UK does a lot mroe money coming out of the pension fund for them cost.
But that deficit of 64.8 per cent include money 44 billion owed to eu under the IMF/EU bailout but that deal was made by a minister only and minister do not make law and cannot make law without dail and oireachtas .. the DAIL TD by failing to have min lay that deal before the Dail and no control ovre what is in the public fund for spending are voint on estimates .. and min with ther vote on the leg can now take pension fund to pay for brexit cos think pee reall nee to go to theIr TD ?
1 Why is that deal by lenihan not laid before dail to reduce that deficit by 85 billion
AND
2 Why was not that ofeer by johnston not in Dail
AND
3 How can TD vote on estimates and min has to have TD VOtes otheriwse he canot touc the money if Dail not n control of what is in kitty ?

It hasn’t been publicly spoken about but the whispers have been going for months. If the WA is not changed sufficiently to allow the UK to sign up to it, the EU have privately said that while they are wiling to take a short-term wait and see approach to a frictionless border, they would not tolerate it long-term. They cannot allow a situation where a country not in the customs union/single market has a channel for the free-flow of goods unchecked into the EU. If the Irish government continue to insist on a frictionless border then the only way to ensure unchecked goods are not reaching the other 26 member states is to have checks on ALL Irish goods at ports of entry to the rest of the EU. This would make ‘just in time’ deliveries to the continent impossible. It would be an absolute disaster for Ireland and the UK government know this. Add to this that poll results in the UK suggest that the outcome of a general election would be a Bojo led Conservative/Brexit party coalition. Even Corbyn realises this, which is why he has dropped the idea of a no-confidence motion which would bring about an election. I really do support the idea of the backstop, but with it in place a no-deal Brexit is inevitable and it’s us who will suffer as a result.

Problem is, how can the EU allow free movement of goods from the Republic, where, in the event of a no-deal Brexit we insist on keeping an open border with a state not in the single market ? It can’t be done. Isn’t that what we’ve been telling the UK for the past 3 years ? That ,other than physical checks, the technology does not exist that could ensure that goods coming into the Republic from NI met with the regulatory requirements of the customs union/single market ? Hence the backstop and keeping NI aligned with EU regulations. But the backstop isn’t going to happen. It’s either remove it which means NI ‘could possibly’ be out of the single market after the transition period ends and no trade deal has been struck which would negate the need for checks on cross-border goods, or leave it in which means a no-deal Brexit and NI out of the single market in 8 weeks time. It doesn’t make sense to just sit back and do nothing, in the hope that the UK parliament will suddenly have a change of heart and vote to ratify an agreement they’ve rejected 3 times already.

Keep in mind that my father weathered the 1930s & late 1940s British trade war.

which had been in effect from Dev’s election in the early 1930s

to mainland EU markets for our goods & services that a no-deal Brexit may block.
We’ll soon see what the benefits of EU membership are particularly when our Irish
workers bailed out the banks under duress from the ECB to avoid systemic EU
banking system collapse. And what did we get? A loan for 5.9% and a raft of Irish new taxes and charges. Not bad eh!

Just leave and let us get on with life. Brexit has taken priority over our housing and heath services problems in Ireland and these are urgent problems that need to be tackled now.!!!! Not a few months/years down the road when they will be asking for yet another extension.
Just leave Boris ……… and let us deal with whatever happens , because as bad as it may be for Ireland and the rest of the EU it will be worse for Britain. And forget about Trump’s promise of a special trade deal between the USA and Britain as a) he needs the backing of both houses , one of which he does not even control and B) he is 1/2 way through his term of presidency and on his way out and I am not even mentioning that he cannot be trusted !!!","Oct 4th 2019, 5:32 PM"

I think the UK population are in for a shock when they leave the EU’s protective umbrella. I can explain the reasons, there are a lot of YouTube videos and articles written by experts that explain it. The two biggest reasons for war in the world is religion and trade. The world is full of trading blocks by geographical area like MERCOSUR, ASEAN, TPP, SADEC, or EU and the reason for that is supply chains. The bigger a trade area’s supply chain infrastructure, the more powerful is its manufacturing output. Ireland is a very small country, but it can source components from the rest of the EU in on-time delivery. Its going to be a big problem for Ireland as Britain acted as the gateway to EU marketplace by road and rail infrastucture. But the EU seem to want Ireland to remain a member and appear willing to invest billions in Ireland, for example, their pledge to give Irish farmers EU subsidies in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Ireland’s ports will have to be ready to bypass the UK and I just wonder how the EU and ROI are going to solve that. The EU are either going to pay Irish farmers EU subsidies forever, or they are going to find a way for Irish farmers to export fresh produce to the EU marketplace without it spoiling.

I feel sorry for those who lose their jobs over it. The EU is what I call a necessary evil in the 21st century. A European country like Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, or France can’t compete with the rest of the world by themselves. China now builds stealth aircraft, renewables, advanced electronics, and so on. There are also many trade blocks similar to the EU in the world like ASEAN, MERCORSUR, TPP, and so on. They are all divided by geographical area, main reason for that are supply chain networks. Most importantly it protects European trade. An IT company in Ireland will struggle to compete with an Indian IT company if India is granted access to services. The only time Indians are used like in call-centers are by European companies operating in Ireland. We can’t pretend that globalism doesn’t exist. Its unfortuante Trump is giving the English the wrong impression as the USA is a huge country with a massive GDP, its practically the same size as the EU, if not bigger. People don’t have a say generally over trade deals, for example, India has demanded easier work VISA access if Britain wants a trade deal with them. 80% of British trade consists of the services sector. Is the British government going to give the British public a referendum on that? I think its decided by trade negotiators. WTO-only rules is awful, because it means one has to apply the same tarriffs to every country in the world! I realise freedom of movement of people upsets some.

2.if a No Deal occurs and a border has to go up Ireland should consider and have a proper debate on whether we should leave the EU. if it is going to be as bad as Leo Varadker and in fact both FF/G say it will be. A referendum in Ireland leaving the ok feel should occur.
We can have an open border if a trade deal was agreed by Ireland and UK. Ensuring peace and Economic growth. Ok feel Scotland will go Independent. And there will have to be trade deals between all three nations. The Common Travel Area will be there for all.
3. Peace and Economic well being should be Ireland’s primary concern. If A No-Deal Brexit occurs and is going to as severe as we are being told them we must put our interests first.

As defined in the Good Friday agreement which was approved by 95% of the Irish electorate and 75% of the Northern Irish Electorate:
1) Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom.
2) A border poll will take place when the NI secretary of state believes that a majority of the NI population wish to leave the UK
3) If a Border poll takes place, and the majority vote against leaving the UK, another poll cannot be called for at least 7 years.

governments of choice and, when elected, that they are not hamstrung with the EU’s
micro economic & social policies.

Even now our Government is very limited to legislate in accordance with the electorate’s
wishes.

systemic risk.

Taxing the people (which no doubt will happen) is like trying to extinguish a burning house, by spraying the house down the road with water! Doesn’t take an economist to see that most workers are already stretched, many small landlords are struggling yet big investors seem content to throw more money in to fuel the fire! So, let’s for once do the right thing, tax the institutional investors without whom inflation would be normal!","Jun 20th 2019, 8:27 AM"

firstly elections the world over (democratic ones anyway), if people fail to cast their votes, its generally because they fail to see the benefit in doing so, or are generally not interested. Those People cant just complain the day after and say they forgot to vote or didn’t understand the importance of issue. If your not in you cant win!
as regards the northern vote – a majority of people voted clearly to remain. it matters little if they were unionist-nationalist or other. That’s the result of the vote. I fail to see your point that because they might have been mainly unionists who stayed at home and didn’t bother to vote, that we should now look at the result differently.
if however, you are suggesting that if another referendum was to take place on the same question tomorrow – that unionists would turn out in their droves to vote Leave? I doubt very much that would be the case. You only need look at Lord Ashcroft’s poll of two weeks ago where 51% of people in the North said they would vote for a U.I. if a border poll was held tomorrow. It was suggested from those results that 5% of Unionists polled (or should I say former unionists) said yes to a U.I.
Now I might be wrong here, but if 5% of Unionists have come to the point where they are considering joining a U.I., then I would suggest a way larger percentage would strongly vote to remain in Europe. Do the maths yourself Simon!

If we are to take the eu”s concerns regarding the inviolability of the single market / customs union at face face value then the logical conclusion of a no deal is that Ireland will be ORDERED to construct a proper border or else see the border be placed in calais instead
The sm/cu in other words , is as far as the eu is concerned , far more important than any sensitivities of the border.
As far as the UK is concerned , the back trap is a non-starter because it will permanently deny the UK it’s own trade policy….therefore no deal it is.

Firstly if current EU regulations require country symbol to be displayed within the number plate when driving abroad, then vast majority of UK drivers when abroad break this rule, as UK number plates with GB symbol included in them are extremely rare. So that means that thousands of UK drivers abroad already are breaking the law.
And secondly if EU regulation stop apply after UK is gone from EU, then we revert to Vienna convention regulations which in fact state exact same thing – that GB symbol has to be either displayed or included in the number plate.
So my verdict is that if you want to drive UK car abroad, you need GB symbol regardless if UK left the EU or not. Effectively nothing is gonna change.","Sep 8th 2019, 9:22 AM"

This is the same tactic that Theresa May used against her opposition in parliament.

Before any agreement can be made on a united Ireland, the people of Northern Ireland need to vote to indicate that they wish to leave the UK and to form part of a united Ireland. That can only be done when the Northern Ireland Secretary of State believes that such a majority is likely. Not possible but “likely”. I would imagine that many opinion polls would need to show a consistent 60% to 70% in favour, before any Northern Ireland Secretary of State will call a border poll. That won’t be for a long while, if ever.
After that the fun begins. The UK will have to put legislation in place to accommodate NI leaving the UK leaving (think Brexit here), Ireland and Northern Ireland would have to come to some sort of an agreement as to what a united Ireland would look like. There would be a number of constitutional referenda required in Ireland. which would have to pass here.

There’s no point in any lay person offering an opinion on this, we need someone suitably medically qualified to give a definitive opinion.
The second issue is that of price. Will generic medication be more expensive, or even branded medication, after Brexit. I think we all know the answer is almost certainly, yes. It doesn’t really matter why, it just will be. A full moon, hurricane Lorenzo, teenagers, the DUP, Brexit. Chose your pick, but prices will almost certainly go up across the board, it’s just a question of how much.
If generic tablet A is the exact same as branded tablet B but a fraction of the price and it’s not being used or dispensed then obviously someone is up to something somewhere along the line.

This is an aticle in the sun newspaper reporting the offer made by BJ to write out a cheque for Ireland Brexit Costs in consderation for the EU Commission accepting the latest UK Proposal.
It was rejected by the EU Commission but bear in mind that as far as the govt is concerned ireland owes the EU 44 Billion Euro and .
1 The public deficit per NTMA Report is in breach of the 60 per cent over GDP limit under the Fisacal Compact Treaty meaning the EU Commission can serve notice on ireland to reduce the deficit within a fixed time frame unless, in the commissions opinion, the excess is due to exceptional circumstances.
2 The EU Commission does not consider brexit costs exceptional circumstances..
3 Twenty per cent of the national debt is out deal made by a minister with the IMF/EU.
4 The law making power reside in the dail and oireachtas. The minister cannot deny a debt . His predecessor made the deal. But Minister Deal are not part of domestic law until legisaltion passed making them so.
5 Minister for Finance whose predecessor made that deal cant say there is no debt ( DAIL CAN but TD have not challenged min power to ignore the dail).
6 He cannot borrow cos that will push up the deficit even further and he is also dippining into the pension fund again to pay for them brexit costs.
5 He could not dip into those fund with out TD votes and legislation making it legal. He got it from them but they have not had him account to the Dail.
6 The failure of the Govt to account to Dail on spending is passing over to brexit.
Was L Varadker informed of thi offer ?
Why was not this proposal not laid before Dail Eireann ? .
From day one B Lenihan told Dail this IMF/EU programe is none of dail business.
TD had NINE YEARS to challenge the govt power to treat the agreement as creating a DEBT so that to day ireland
1 is in breach of the 60 per cent deficit under fiscal compact treaty and brexit cost are NOT exceptional circumstances for the purposes of a notice from the commission requiring govt to reduce deficit within a timeframe to ireland as a debtor. They can make life v v hard. .
and
2 A proposal made by BJ to pay ireland cost has not been laid before the dail for Ireland price to remove the backstop . Is it a border poll ? A cheque? removal of review of NI being part of eu regulations and custom union to UK and Ire in amend to Good Friday Agreement on proceedure for triggering poll and how frequent ?
What did L Varadker say on his cycling trip in Denmark ? .
Ireland will welcome application by uk for an extension
v
UK is saying deal or out ?
The EU refused to enter into negotiations with the UK over the weekend.
That may well be commission telling UK that UK needs to come to an agreement with Ireland and saying to the govt if u do not agree to the UK proposal we cannot guarantee that UK will not leave on 31 10 and if they do the cost are ireland responsibiility and ire is in breach of the fiscal compact treaty ? And that is the case for as long as DAIL is out of picture.
If u read that article u will see that some eu member states are tiered of ireland logjamming brexit and saying that ireland should name its price.
Our govt is looking to the EU to be member of single market with no hard border but if UK leave then N I goes and there is a border UNTIL a majority in north say otherwise The Stopgap is about the Good Friday Agreement as much as it is about money ? . .
it appear hugary may veto any extension to the uk if it is sought. ..
L Varadker is cycling arond denmark,
M L McDonnald is off in wales.
The laying of the deal before the dail will be message to international communcity and eu that deal made by minister are not part of domestic law save by legislation and Dail has issues on terms of min deal and UK proposal bearing in mind that the EU Commission can make life very v difficult for the Govt under the Fiscal Compact Treaty and the exclusion of the DAIL in the deal made by B Lenihan that burden public fund with the cost of keeping banks capitalised to EU standards irrespective of the role of the ECB in the ability to make money ?
.
POD is preparing a no deal brexit budget aremd with legislation ( again) voted on by TD ( he had to have their votes ) giving him key to pension fund to pay for brexit costs as L Varadker informs uk that irleand will welcome an application by the Uk for an extension and UK making this offer or out on 31 10. . TD can tell POD we will vote your estimate but u lay that IMF/EU deal before the Dail and u get that into neg with BJ on Ireland price for removing backstop.
But if BJ does leave on 31 with no deal we are responsible for cot of a no deal brexit and for as long as the IMF/EU deal not laid before the Dail then dont hold your breath and as for the North .. all i can say M L McDonnald lost her opportunity to put her price for withdrawal of backstp and tht is becasue she never challenged govt attitude to that deal and exclusiong of the DAL .","Oct 6th 2019, 3:23 AM"

Everibody wish a united Ireland, but how. I remember the same in Germany in 1990. Everybody was happy until the bill was presented to the West Germans. There had to be billions to be invested in the old DDR. and the peolple from the Ost didn’t have the money. For years Germany could not keep his inflation to the maximum 3%. The taxes became very hight in the West, In the Ost the unemployment rose. The different in wages had to be balanced over many years. In other words, the Ost Germans were a lot better off, they kept there homes free of mortgages, farmers became millionaires, while in the West their was struggle. I worked in Germany years later and I could feel the impact to the German people. Even now the Germans from the old DDR, are in the Bundes Republic still count as THey from the Ost. even after 25 years.
So an Unification is not so simple and should take years of preparation. Let us learn from the rush mistake in 1990. Make a United Ireland, but prepare yourself.

2. As a former World Power, the U.K. finds it difficult to accept they are no longer such, and not used to being answered ‘No’ by the world’s largest economic area.

Quote: “The concept of a “dormant citizenship” means that a person has the citizenships of two countries, but as long as he/she lives permanently in the one country, his/her status and citizens’ rights in the other country are “inactive.” They will be “reactivated” when he/she moves back to and lives permanently in the other country. This means, in spite of dual citizenship, only one citizenship can be exercised at a time.
The “dormant citizenship” exists for example in Spain: Spanish citizens who have naturalized in an Iberoamerican country and have kept their Spanish citizenship are technically dual citizens, but have lost their rights as Spanish—and EU—citizens until they move back to and live permanently in Spain”
Taken from https://noordinjella.livejournal.com/83398.html but you can google it.
Perhaps each country decides if the dormant citizenship rule applies in their territory. I am citizen of 3 countries and I am aware that two of them applies this rule.

Strange that we didn’t witness the same uproar when parliament took its traditional conference recess last Sept-Oct, or the Sept-Oct before that. In fact, every Sept-Oct in living memory. Remainers have been banging on about this traditional break all summer, trotting out it’s official name, Proroging, which very few had ever heard of, to make it appear like it was something unusual. Personally I think it’s ridiculous to take a recess at such a crucial time, but it’s worth remembering that not one remain supporting party cancelled their annual conference or called for the traditional Sept-Oct recess to be cancelled. They wanted it to go ahead so that it could be used as a political weapon. If people want to, rightly, point the finger at the Leave movement for sharp practice, then they have to also call this faux uproar of the past week for exactly what it is.

This is report in the sun of BJ offer to write a cheque for Ireland Brexit cost,if the eu accepts his proposal as an alt to backstop.
some eu member state are fed up with ireland logjamming brexit and that IRELAND NAME IT PRICE in short our politician getting ther space to name IRLAND PRICE ?
My question why wasnt this laid before Dail by taoiseach for Dail to name ireland price for ireland consent to the removal of the backstop?
The space correct space for ML McDonald to call for her poll .
OR
is it the cheque .
or
that review clause be transferred out of stormont and into the Joint hand of the parties to the good friday agreement and not just UK as set out in UK Legislation >
Under NTMA report for 18 Ireland deficit breaches the 60 per cent threshold under the fiscal compact treaty and as far as EU is concerned brexit costs are not an exceptional circumstance releiving ireland form a notice form commission that govt reduce tht deficit as a debtor.
Minister cannot borrow for them costs as that will push deficit up more.
it is why minister is dipping into pensions fund AND CAN only do that cos TD gave him the vote in legislation the key to pensions fund to pay for mitigating ‘exceptionall circumstances in minister view that may not be view of the EU Commission .
But TD have not and are still allowing min to ignore DAIL in the IMF/EU deal that has pushed deficit over 60 per cent deficit and NOW loss of opp to set out ireland price to removing backstop ?
TD are complaining that 500 million not going into rainy day fund can tell
Min must have TD vote to approve estimates ( TD who gave him key to take 8 billion out of pension fund to pay for over spends) and those TD can now tell Min that he will get their vote but he must lay that deal now before the Dail to reduce that deficit and that proposal from BJ on dail table for DAIL to instruct govt on Ireland price for withdrawal of the backstop.
Leo Varadker told uk ireland will consent to an application by the uk for an extension . The UK has said if EU does not accept the deal and remove the backstop the UK will leave the EU on 31 October 2019. And that includes N I until majority in N say otherwise under good friday agreement .
The EU Commission did not hold negotiations with the UK over the weekend .
The commission may be telling UK to make a deal with Ireland for Ire consent to the removal of the backstop and govt if u do not make a deal with the UK we cannot guarantee that the UK and N I will not be out of the EU on 31 Oct 19 and if that happens then there will be a border and ireland is responsible for the costs and ireland is is debtor.
The govt has been clear all along on this huge issue .. cos minister signed up to deal but excluded the DAIL and it is blowng up now on international agremeent ? It is TD who have been opague and as a result the deficit under the fiscal compact treaty is over 60 per cent threshold as UK ready to leave EU and as far as eu is concerned ireland is responsible for the costs .. only dail can reduce that deficit ?

And Im not saying its the boogy man they are portraying it to be, but the steady march towards a federalisation of Europe is behind all of this. The erosion of the sovereignty of the individual countries, and the rule of bureaucratic elites. I believe in a European Union, based on the co-operation of each individual state in a group, but not the co-option of the state into a federal entity which would always rule from afar, and rule to the whims of the most politically powerful countries. I believe in the single market, to a certain degree the concept of EU citizenship and the rights it conveys within the member states, but the interminable march into pushing back the boundaries of the states and their own influence on their internal policies and regulations needs to be brought to a halt. I believe it is desirous to have a Union of European states, with a common market and common goals. I just believe we have overshot that, and the medicine that was once prescribed to help overcome the struggles between Europes nation states, is not helping anymore. Its actually killing the patient. We need to row back to a point on the other side of the Lisbon treaty. We were right to refuse it the first time, and our own government and political classes in their eagerness to be part of the big experiment and be Good Europeans refused to bring our judgement of the situation to the bureaucracy and tell them we dont want this, and in truth neither did the populations of many other countries, but they were not offered referendums to show they didnt. Brexit is simply the first symptom of the ailment that is killing the patient, because they should have stopped taking the medicine when they were stable, but now they are hooked and simply cant see life as being livable without it.","Oct 10th 2019, 11:07 AM"

“When 14-year-old Philip Rafferty left his home in west Belfast to go to band practice, his mother, Maureen, made sure he was wearing his new winter coat. The next time she saw it was in a plastic bag at his inquest, saturated with blood.
On January 30th, 1973, Philip was on his way home when he was abducted from the street by loyalist paramilitaries. He was taken to the Giant’s Ring, outside Belfast, where they hooded him with his coat, beat him, and then shot him several times.
The night before, the same UDA gang had shot and killed another teenager, Peter Watterson, who was standing outside his mother’s newsagents on the nearby Falls Road. Philip and Peter were among a number of victims of sectarian murders of Catholic children carried out by loyalists at that time.”","Oct 8th 2019, 2:25 PM"

If he does this, a British general election will be allowed to happen quickly afterwards and Johnson will probably be rewarded by the British public who will just be relieved that Brexit has been legally completed and they can move on to negotiating the most important thing which is the Free Trade Agreement.
The electoral threat from Nigel Farage will recede if Boris Johnson takes the UK out of the EU on October 31st, even under Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, because even arch-Conservative voters will be happy that Johnson has actually managed to deliver some form of Brexit and the oxygen will largely be taken out of the issue. The alternative for Conservative voters, if they were to vote for Farage, would be to put Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street.
If Johnson returns with a Conservative Party majority after the UK general general election he will never again need the DUP who, actions speaking louder than words, have been the single biggest obstacle to Brexit. Negotiating a Free Trade Agreement will then be much easier.
As Angela Merkel pointed out on the phone to Boris Johnson today, if Germany wanted to leave the EU it would be perfectly possible for the Germans to leave the customs union; but with Britain’s border dividing the island of Ireland and with all of the issues this gives rise to in regard to peace and in regard to the integrity of the single market, it is simply not possible for Northern Ireland to leave the customs union.

Rather JOHNSTON has made concessions that keeps the 6 counties in both customs union and single market for everything. Bye bye DUP. Hello UK ports like Cairnryan which become the de facto border between EU/ROI/NI/UK. No veto for DUP but possibly a time frame (mini backstop) to focus on a proper FTA between EU/UK in the future. Stormont to re-open for business to rubber stamp the Agreement under GFA. Most traders on U.K. “mainland” don’t give a flying fig for farmers or businesses in NI so no backlash there. UK Parliament free to pass the deal so no need for an election ( but Boris will want one to secure a working majority). EU machinations? Plus ca change !,"Oct 11th 2019, 1:11 PM"

So NI would officially be part of the UK customs zone if the EU agreed not to collect tarrifs on NI goods entering the the republic while all Goods entering NI from the UK would have EU customs collected on them at the ports. The goods shipped to NI from UK would have customs rebates from the UK if they were proved to not enter the the republic. This is totally the border in the Irish sea and peace on the Island. It’s also brilliant for the North as in practice the UK won’t be able to figure out what goods are NI bound only so goods sent to the EU through NI will have a competitive advantage to those flowing to the EU from Britain directly.,"Oct 11th 2019, 3:35 PM"

Obviously a referendum system would be better for Ireland as after 4 years of competitive advantage and job creation for the NI through becoming a massive clearing house it would be hoped they would not kill the golden calf. They voted that way in the origional referendum so I have faith in them. This would probably be better for the DUP than a simple majority Stormont vote.

Who knows what is going to happen on October 31st regarding Brexit but if the UK ask for another extension it should be granted based on either article 50 being withdrawn or another referendum where leaving with no deal is not one of the options.

If they have Irish relatives that they keep in touch with they are normally clued in to various degrees but if there is no Irish connection then we might as well be at the far side of the planet.
I used to go to a bar near Kinsale which was my when I visited my parents and used to regularly meet British people over on holidays. To say that they were stunned at the level of knowledge that the locals had about British history, politics and current affairs would be an understatement. In return, you could write the British knowledge about Ireland on the back of a postage stamp. We are apparently a cross between Father Ted and The Quiet Man. GFA,forget about it. Irish history “Wasn’t the a Famine or somfink?”. Why don’t we join the Commonwealth and leave the EU? One lad couldn’t understand why so many NI reg cars were in the area around the 12th of July. When I explained the reason he confessed that he thought that OO parades were like some sort of Patricks Day celebration!
It’s not that they are deliberately ignorant it’s just that they are taught British history through rose coloured glasses. Borris Johnson thinks that the Empire still exists. He even recited parts of “The road to Mandalay” while in Myanmar (Burma) before being told to shut up by a clearly exasperated British Ambassader. I’m surprised he didn’t give us a verse of “The Sash my father wore” the last time he was in Dublin.
It’s this hankering after Empire that has screwed them over Brexit. They are used to being the big boys at the table and can’t handle being the small boys now.

When you think about it, the citizens’ assembly was established at the height of the economic crisis when the Troika directed the country’s fiscal policies. Young people, who bore the brunt of the austerity measures, had little control over the situation. So, Fine Gael enthusiastically rowed in behind the citizens’ assembly, which focused exclusively on social issues which cost the State very little from a budgetary perspective, rather than a constitutional right to housing which could be very problematic. The citizens’ assembly was a media creation: it gave legitimacy to furthering this liberal agenda, which the media rowed in behind 100%. Of course those constitutional amendments were passed, the media and political elite were completely biased. There really wasn’t a choice. Just like the Troika/Bank guarantee: the media decreed that we had to accept the debts of Anglo Irish Bank and the people did. If you are so pleased with the citizens’ assembly, why not do away with Dáil Éireann entirely? The citizens’ assembly was just a means of legitimization outcomes predetermined by the Fine Gael government. It’s a fraud.","Jun 17th 2019, 2:17 AM"

Of course….prices actually are dropping which is a good thing.

https://www.thejournal.ie/economy-brexit-4721430-Jul2019/,"To all those folks who still think house prices are what they are… due to housing supply , allow me to educate you.
High House price rises are not due to supply (or lack thereof ) not due either 2 lack of land , or high immigrantion
The reason they have gone up is an over abundant supply of FAKE mortgage cash.
In the same way everything has gone up in price (in local currency ) in Zimbabwe or venezuala, so house prices have gone up all over the western world for the same reason .
I only learnt last year that when a mortgage is created – the actual cash is freshly minted ( in a vurtual sense) there and then by the private bank issuing the loan.
B4 the issuance of that mortgage, that money didn’t exist anywhere .
That banks have this power to lend money from nowhere – 2 create money from nowhere ,means that with time the buying power of said mortgage money keeps getting less and less as more mortgages and thus more freshly printed money is lent.
There was a time in the UK when the majority of mortgage money was issued by building societies
. From the 40s thru to the late 70s prices remained exactly in line with wages. It’s no coincidence that building societies unlike banks couldn’t and still can’t print money – they have to burrow it themselves or other depositers.
Since no new supply of money is involved in the issuance of these mortgages, the buying power of said cash remains constant and so consequently do house prices.
At the end of the 70s the banks were unleashed and the restrictions in mortgage lending were lifted ( the main restriction being that for every 1 pound lent in mortgages 4 times as much needs to be lent to industry ).
Good sensible laws preventing bank issued mortgage cash from the times of the 2nd world war were done away with , building societies were de mutualised and themselves became banks – and the flood of fake cash began.
Still ..
There is a bright side… when the supply or issuance of said mortgage reduces ( in another words we get credit de-acceraltion ) gdp drops and so do house prices.
We are seeing that now in the UK – and Ireland will soon follow suit . This is nothing to do with Brexit – but simply the phenomenon of what the economist prof minskey called ‘credit de-acceleration ‘","Jul 12th 2019, 1:44 PM"

https://www.thejournal.ie/budget-2020-discussions-carbon-tax-4802720-Sep2019/,"75% of the people do not want an carbon tax.
Some believe that all should be paid with the tax that is allready levied and by the industry . But than there will be no money left for : Art, hospitals, road repairs, public transport, elderly care, etc etc.
The amount of money for climate combat will cost op to 20 billion a year for a few years to put this in perspective that is the totall amount off the entire social care. Let this amount off money sink in for a while.
On this moment political parties are debating what to do with the carbon tax money
There are 2 possibilities
———————————
Nr one green party
——————————
They will give 180 Euro back on every worker included the higher wages.
All is based on the fact that rich people use more fossil fuel than poorer but get the same amount of money back as the poorer.
And thus are more inclined to invest in green energie. Fossil fuel price will go up..
The problem with this is that the industry is paying a lot of carbon tax and so the will raise the price of their goods that means that the consumer is paying.
Yes i can see that it will work.
But there is a lot less money available. And so will work slow.
————————————————–
Nr two
————————————————-
If only money is given back to the poorer than all the rest off the money can be invested in green energy industry.
So creating jobs and extra tax. Fossil fuel price will go up
In comparison with the first idea this will work super fast and gives jobs in to the bargain.
I believe that most better earners will not be to worried about the 180 Euro a year after all it’s for the best of their children.

Meanwhile, he is at his party conference which was penned in for this month way before Prorogation was ever mentioned. At this time of year parliament takes a 3.5 week break to allow for party conferences. Because parliament only sits 4 days per week, this effectively means that proroging parliament increased the non-sitting days by 5/6 days. After almost 3yrs of parliamentary deadlock over Brexit, do people really believe that these 5 or 6 days could have been the days when all the parties had a huge change of heart and decided to sit down and work out their differences ? Even if all the parties had cancelled their conferences, had no conference recess and Bojo had not prorogued parliament, what would it have achieved ? Absolutely nothing, that’s what. Labour have consistently voted against a deal, voted against no-deal, voted against a motion to revoke A50 and voted against a motion to call a second referendum. Even if Johnson came back from the EU next week with a deal that was exactly what Labour was asking for, Labour would vote against it.

In the first Miller case, they ruled that the conventions (as opposed to the legal rules) of the unwritten British Constitution were not justiciable (not a matter for the courts).
The prorogation of Parliament is a convention, not a legal rule. Also, the PM’s advice to the UK’s queen is a convention, and is not measured by a legal rule. But now the judges have radically changed their minds and have decided that the conventions are justiciable. This suggests that the court’s ruling is inherently political.

Just a few realities. At the moment there are no customs formalities on any import or export trade with the UK. In 2018 Irish Customs processed about 180k customs declarations (between import and export). After Brexit, whatever form that takes, there will be a 10fold increase in customs declarations.

He contrasts their approach highly unfavourably with that of Sinn Féin who consulted broadly in the run up to the GFA and who have continued to brief their base. Well worth a read.

Ms De Soussa and her parent(s) (presuming at least one was born in the 6 counties) were always considered British as of Birth, in the eyes of British law and indeed many other countries bar Ireland (least not officially) . Even with her entitlement to be Irish, since the day she was born, it did not revoke her British citizenship. GFA says NOTHING about that . There is a difference in what some one claims to be and the actual issue eg (bad example) I might say that I am not a Catholic, because I don’t practice, but, I was baptised as one and never really renounced it (not sure there is an official way unless I convert to another religion )
For immigration purposes, since she never left the UK, the EU courts would not, based on a very similar case before them in 2011, recognise the duel nationality (I would love to see what the courts would say in light of GFA ,however, I’d fear that they might accept the reasoning from the recent judgment)
The rule about not being automatically British, deals with stopping illegals claiming their child is British even if the parents only spent 1 day in Britain (they fixed their rules in 1986, we did it in 2004 for the same reason) . That non automatic issue is highly likely to have absolutely no bearing to Ms De Soussa even if she was born after 1986
Before the 2004 Irish Citizenship Act amendments , our Citizenship laws (1956 Act as amended) did NOT give automatic citizenship rights , as of birth, to the Irish in the 6 counties. This was given to anyone in the South .
What was given to the Nordies was that were “entitled” to be Irish and this would be proven by getting an Irish passport. I accept one might see little difference in that in practice, but there kinda is a difference, albeit a small one, Southerners as of birth were assumed to be Irish without the need of a passport, the Nordies had to get the passport.
That never meant the British would respect it though. How many Northern Irish sports stars were always assumed to be British , even if they clearly were of the other tribe? Legally, it was still accurate. But, hey, the Brits took a long time to accept our country’s proper title in the English Language, always abusing the use of the term Éire. The previous citizenship regime sought to ensure that the British could not claim that Ireland was claiming them (that did not stop them however)
“So, the GFA actually never granted any special status to people from the north”
Kinda, yes. Most People up North could always get Irish Citizenship, but GFA says it is automatic. Remember the journalist Brian Kennan, EAST Belfast man. His Irish passport probably saved him from certain death when he was kidnapped in the Lebanon in 1986
As for people in the North renouncing their British Citizenship, hmm, be careful,until there is something set in ink, you would hardly want the British to treat you lot as Foreigners once they leave the UK","Oct 18th 2019, 2:59 PM"
